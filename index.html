<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Boatowner&#39;s Illustrated Handbook of Wiring</h2><p><p>Taking the baton from International Marine's best-selling <i>12-Volt Bible for Boats</i> and <i>Boatowner's Mechanical and Electrical Manual,</i> <i>Boatowner's Illustrated Handbook of Wiring</i> delves deeper into the how-to-wire, how-to-solder approach of the former and the electrical system design, troubleshooting, and improvement aspects of the latter. DC and AC wiring materials and techniques are all covered, as are batteries, alternators, inverters, generators, corrosion control, and alternate energy installations (solar, wind, and water). There are detailed instructions for wiring radios, loran, and other radio navigation devices. The dozens of weekend projects include installing cabin lights, navigation lights, burglar alarms, battery charge indicators, bilge alarms, and much more. Extensive tables summarize the most important information and specifications in a quick-reference format.</p> <p><i>Boatowner's Illustrated Handbook of Wiring</i> is a user-friendly, roll-up-your-sleeves manual for onboard electrical projects, from fixing loose connections to rewiring the boat. Simple, clear, and abundantly illustrated, here is the key to understanding and customizing you boat's DC and AC systems.</p></p><p>Charlie Wing earned his U.S. Coast Guard captain&#39;s license in the early 1990s. His frustration with available study guides led him to create Get Your Captain&#39;s License. A former Bowdoin College physics professor and research scientist for NASA, Wing has a reputation for demystifying complex topics. The author of several top-selling home-maintenance and remodeling books and founder of two house-building schools, Wings has also written Boatowner&#39;s Illustrated Handbook of Wiring, The Liveaboard Report, and Boating Magazine&#39;s One-Minute guide to Nautical Rules of the Road (all International Marine).``The square format allows large, clearly defined and labeled wiring diagrams, an attribute that is worth its weight in gold when sprawled on a cabin sole in 90-degree heat with the floorboards up and a multimeter in hand troubleshooting some mystery short.''

If you're looking for the management system with genuine staying power and that can produce dramatic and measurable results over both the short and long term, this revealing guide by one of the nation's leading behavioral psychologists describes the most important management strategy you will ever implement in your company.<br>The system?

The step-by-step methods you'll learn from this book are applicable to all people and all organizations all of the time! Use Dr. Daniels' tested performance management system to define reinforcers that work - and tailor them to meet individual employees' needs; set fair performance measurement standards - implement and maintain them with minimal cost and effort; provide constant feedback and reinforcement - the most powerful tools for enabling employees to improve and maintain their own performance; build effective reinforcers into every area of your organization - from compensation and incentive packages... to work rules... to office machinery that's employee-friendly; and eliminate those management practices which have been shown not to bring out the best in people - including slogans, exhortations, and numerical goals and quotas.<br>Backed by performance management case studies at 3M, Xerox, Hewlett Packard, and other major firms, Bringing Out the Best in People gives you not only the tools you need to permanently revitalize productivity, but also a powerful reinforcement system for transforming your employees' work into something they're ready, willing - and yes, eager - to do.</p><p>A powerfully positive system for gaining maximum performance from every employee. <p> What motivates people?

It includes fifteen ethnographic case studies to give students a strong sense of the intricate interconnections between kinship and gender as a lived experience and among a variety of cultural groups.</p><p><b>Linda Stone</b> is professor emeritus of anthropology at Washington State University. She is the coauthor of <i>Gender and Culture in America<i> and <i>Genes, Culture, and Human Evolution<i>.<br></i></i></i></i>"Stone's innovative approach to a difficult subject makes it abundantly clear that kinship is not passe. She weaves current cross-cultural stories and illustrations throughout the text to show how kinship values ground an individual in society.<br>&#x2014;<b>Lina Fruzzetti, Brown University</b><br><br>Praise for Previous Editions:<br><br>"Stone's excellent text offers a broad introduction to key concepts in an anthropological understanding of the family."<br>&#x2014;<b>William Donner, Kutztown University</b><br><br>"A wonderfully nuanced introduction to the relationships between kinship, gender roles, and reproductive life in a cross-cultural perspective. In addition to exploring the diversity of gendered relationships, Stone provides mechanisms that allow students to understand why particular gender roles develop in particular societies."<br>&#x2014;<b>Shane Macfarlan, Oregon State University</b><br><br>"This is an excellent text for teaching, with compelling case studies and an engaging, accessible style. In offering an argument for the combining of &#x2018;kinship' and &#x2018;gender' into one domain of inquiry, it represents an invitation to students and scholars alike to revitalize kinship studies by drawing on gender scholarship. Now with additional material on contemporary social problems, this book is more user-friendly than ever."<br>&#x2014;<b>Diane E.

Death does the same . . . but death comes only once . . . and choices about food come many times each day. In <i>The Ethics of Food</i>, Gregory E. Pence brings together a collection of voices who share the view that the ethics of genetically modified food is among the most pressing societal questions of our time. This comprehensive collection addresses a broad range of subjects, including the meaning of food, moral analyses of vegetarianism and starvation, the safety and environmental risks of genetically modified food, issues of global food politics and the food industry, and the relationships among food, evolution, and human history. Will genetically modified food feed the poor or destroy the environment? Is it a threat to our health? Is the assumed healthfulness of organic food a myth or a reality? The answers to these and other questions are engagingly pursued in this substantive collection, the first of its kind to address the broad range of philosophical, sociological, political, scientific, and technological issues surrounding the ethics of food.</p><p><b>Gregory E. Pence</b> is a medical ethicist with twenty years of experience reviewing significant cases in bioethics, and is professor in the School of Medicine and the Department of Philosophy at the University of Alabama. Pence has contributed to the<i>New York Times</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, and the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. He is the author of <i>Classical Cases in Medical Ethics: Accounts of the Cases that Shaped Medical Ethics, 3rd edition</i> (2000) and <i>Who's Afraid of Human Cloning?</i> (1998).An excellent introduction for undergraduates. A broad range of problems is treated in an engaging and lucid manner. Nice bibliographies. (Dr. S. N. Fratantaro, Providence College)<br><br>Nicely produced. (<i>Food Science and Technology</i>)<br><br>Both the publishers and the editor are to be commended for bringing together such diverse viewpoints in one, easy-to-read volume. (<i>Experimental Agriculture</i>)<br><br>The reader is led to compellingly consider the pressing issues of starvation, the consumption of meat and the benefits and dangers of genetically modified food. (<i>Science and Theology News</i>)<br><br>Finally, we have a book that speaks to one of the most pressing, though under-examined, issues in our biotech age. Greg Pence has produced, again, a stimulating and timely text. Crisp and comprehensive in its approach, <i>The Ethics of Food</i> takes stock of the morally imperative questions surrounding food production, modification, and consumption, particularly their global impact upon ecosystems. The text offers a judicious menu of readings that articulate differing perspectives from various fields. Combining scholarship and access, this pioneering work insightfully underscores the ongoing tension between food biotechnologies and biodiversity, compelling us to move toward reasonable resolutions. (Michael Brannigan, executive director, Center for the Study of Ethics, La Roche College)</p><h2>Nietzsche: The Ethics of an Immoralist</h2><p><p>Once regarded as a conservative critic of culture, then enlisted by the court theoreticians of Nazism, Nietzsche has come to be revered by postmodern thinkers as one of their founding fathers, a prophet of human liberation who revealed the perspectival character of all knowledge and broke radically with traditional forms of morality and philosophy.</p><p>In <i>Nietzsche: The Ethics of an Immoralist</i>, Peter Berkowitz challenges this new orthodoxy, asserting that it produces a one-dimensional picture of Nietzsche's philosophical explorations and passes by much of what is provocative and problematic in his thought. Berkowitz argues that Nietzsche's thought is rooted in extreme and conflicting opinions about metaphysics and human nature. Discovering a deep unity in Nietzsche's work by exploring the structure and argumentative movement of a wide range of his books, Berkowitz shows that Nietzsche is a moral and political philosopher in the Socratic sense whose governing question is, "What is the best life?"</p><p>Nietzsche, Berkowitz argues, puts forward a severe and aristocratic ethics, an ethics of creativity, that demands that the few human beings who are capable acquire a fundamental understanding of and attain total mastery over the world. Following the path of Nietzsche's thought, Berkowitz shows that this mastery, which represents a suprapolitical form of rule and entails a radical denigration of political life, is, from Nietzsche's own perspective, neither desirable nor attainable.</p><p>Out of the colorful and richly textured fabric of Nietzsche's books, Peter Berkowitz weaves an interpretation of Nietzsche's achievement that is at once respectful and skeptical, an interpretation that brings out the love of truth, the courage, and the yearning for the good that mark Nietzsche's magisterial effort to live an examined life by giving an account of the best life.</p></p><p>Peter Berkowitz challenges the popular postmodern portrait of Nietzsche, arguing that it passes by what is truly daring and enduring in Nietzsche&#39;s philosophical explorations.Peter Berkowitz is Associate Professor of Government at Harvard University.</p><h2>Thomas Jefferson&#39;s Farm Book: With Commentary and Relevant Extracts from Other Writings</h2><p>Book by Jefferson, Thomas</p><p></p><h2>On Broadway: From Rent to Revolution</h2><p>A visual and oral history of the past twenty years of theater, <i>On Broadway</i> pulls back the curtain to reveal the creative process involved in bringing a Broadway show to the stage and into the public consciousness through the words of Broadway&#x2019;s most famous personalities and the art of SpotCo.

Open the pages of Ed Schuster's book and you'll find an energetic, untraditional, creative means of helping students become independent thinkers and more effective writers.</p> <p>Schuster acknowledges that there ARE bedrock rules of English syntax that should be honored, and offers lesson plans to show how these rules can be taught effectively, in ways that empower students and enable them to write with confidence, authority, and precision. He also examines the history of the other rules, the "myth rules" that are the legacy of traditional school grammar-taught for hundreds of years but infrequently followed outside of the classroom, as shown in numerous examples of the best contemporary writing. He devotes his book to better ways of teaching grammar, usage, writing, and punctuation by </p><ul> <li>teaching the unbreakable rules in such a way that they stay taught</li> <li>debunking the "myth rules" that are commonly taught in class, but infrequently followed in practice</li> <li>trusting students' own intuitive sense of grammaticality</li> <li>appealing to the evidence of the work of his own and others' students and to the best contemporary writing.</li> </ul><p></p> <p>"Only look and connect" is the guiding principle of Schuster's book. Look at the results of your teaching; look at the facts of language; look at practices of our best writers, both student and professional; look to see which rules really rule. Then connect what you discover to your teaching practice.</p></p><p><p>Edgar H. Schuster has taught English in secondary schools and in colleges for more than forty years.

Here he shares the secrets from his highly successful public relations firm on how to take care of business and grow the bottom line. In Full Frontal PR, readers learn how to hone their pitch, build relationships with the press, and gain strategic placements that will get people talking. These tactics are based on proven methods that are easy to implement and, most important. cost-effective. For those looking to raise their profile and reach new customers, this acclaimed book will help any company or person break through the clutter and into the center of attention.</p><p>Richard Laermer is CEO of RLM PR (RLMpr.com). A renowned speaker, he is author of seven books such as the bestseller &#34;Full Frontal PR&#34; and &#34;2011: Trendspotting&#34;. He hosts &#34;Taking Care of Business&#34; on TLC and is a commentator on CNNMoney.com. He lives in New York--and on tons of airplanes.For a public relations professional, Laermer might have succeeded too well with this book: it could threaten to put firms like his own, RLM PR, out of business. After all, write Laermer and co-author Prichinello in this do-it-yourself guide for snaring publicity, the PR industry's dirty little secret is that "you can create the buzz factor yourself." Among the tips: adopt a media-friendly approach that cultivates friends rather than making enemies; use a host of tactics like embargoes, leaks, source filings and exclusives to your best advantage; and give yourself a leg up by knowing what time-pressed journalists are looking for and handing it to them on a platter. The authors bolster their case with examples of good and bad PR: e.g., how BigStar, an online movie retailer, spun its competition with Blockbuster into a David and Goliath tale, or how Kozmo.com's reliance on the media's love affair with its CEO compromised its ability to deliver on its promises. Some troubling references slip in (Laermer's own staffers watch the movies Wall Street and Boiler Room to get revved up for pitching journalists, and the authors admit "someone once told us that media people often dislike PR practitioners a lot"), but, that aside, this is a valuable road map to the land of buzz. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to the Sonnet (Cambridge Companions to Literature)</h2><p>Beginning with the early masters of the sonnet form, Dante and Petrarch, the Companion examines the reinvention of the sonnet across times and cultures, from Europe to America. In doing so, it considers sonnets as diverse as those by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, George Herbert and e. e. cummings. The chapters explore how we think of the sonnet as a &#39;lyric&#39; and what is involved in actually trying to write one. The book includes a lively discussion between three distinguished contemporary poets - Paul Muldoon, Jeff Hilson and Meg Tyler - on the experience of writing a sonnet, and a chapter which traces the sonnet&#39;s diffusion across manuscript, print, screen and the internet. A fresh and authoritative overview of this major poetic form, the Companion expertly guides the reader through the sonnet&#39;s history and development into the global multimedia phenomenon it is today.</p><p>Covering sonnets as diverse as those by Dante, Shakespeare and e. e. cummings, distinguished scholars and poets discuss this major poetic form as a global and multimedia phenomenon.

She won a Newbery Honor for <i>On My Honor</i>, a middle grade coming-of-age story. She lives in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. www.mariondanebauer.com.</p>An award-winning novelist (On My Honor, 1987 Newbery Honor) and experienced writing teacher cogently discusses her craft. As John Gardner did in The Art of Fiction (1984), Bauer insists on technique and deliberation over inspiration and natural endowment, reminding readers that no musical virtuoso ever captivated without a command of the notes. After spelling out the need to regulate the writing habit, she settles into the nitty- gritty of gathering and expanding ideas; building on characters, plot, and themes; and, yes, mastering grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Her last comment is telling: ``Knowing your craft can help you tell a story. But only by taking risks can you make art.'' After many pages of provocative information and straightforward counsel, that sentence may be the one to launch youngsters to the challenge. The book speaks directly to young writers, but many adults (teachers, librarians, reviewers, editors, would-be writers) will also find this sensible dissection of the storytelling process invaluable.

Popkin also emphasizes schools and developments that have traditionally been overlooked. Sections on Aristotle and Plato are followed by a detailed presentation on Hellenic philosophy and its influence on the modern developments of materialism and scepticism. A chapter has been dedicated to Jewish and Moslem philosophical development during the Middle Ages, focusing on the critical role of figures such as Averro�s and Moses Maimonides in introducing Christian thinkers to classical philosophy. Another chapter considers Renaissance philosophy and its seminal influence on the development of modern humanism and science.<br><br>Turning to the modern era, contributors consider the importance of the Kaballah to Spinoza, Leibniz, and Newton and the influence of popular philosophers like Moses Mendelssohn upon the work of Kant.

This book is a transcription of this dialogue, containing illuminating advice on holding the viola, bowing, tone, fingering, and practicing, all supported by copious illustrations and musical examples, as well as insights on repertoire for the viola--&#34;an instrument without tradition&#34;--and on performances of the great concertos by Bartok and Walton. Punctuated with frankness and humor, this book is a tribute to one of the greatest artists of this century.</p><p>David Dalton is at Brigham Young University, Utah; President of American Viola Society.<br>"Required reading for all violists and should be found on the shelves of every library at institutions where the viola is taught."--<em>Notes</em><p></p><br>"This remarkable book is full of valuable information about performance problems on the viola and the methodology for their solutions....The book certainly should be required reading for all violists, and it is particularly indispensable to teachers and students of the instrument. All violists are indebted to David Dalton for making it possible to share the wisdom, advice, and many wonderful experiences of one of the musical giants of our time."--Maurice W. Riley, <em>American String Teacher</em><p></p><br>"An invaluable reference for the violist whether student, teacher, or performer. The combination of wit and knowledge enables the reader to enjoy thoroughly the process of reading....Recommended for all who are interested in the viola and its greatest exponent."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"This volume is an invaluable contribution to the string player's bookshelf. The clarity with which Mr. Dalton has distilled the ideas of the great William Primrose forms a wonderful basis for a technical approach on both violin and viola. As one who had the rare privilege of studying and performing with the great master, it was very much like a personal visit."--Joseph Silverstein, <em>former Concert Master of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Music Director of the Utah Symphony</em><p></p><br>"In all areas of human endeavour, time and again an individual appears who, due to a multitude of personal attributes, elevates his or her field to a hitherto unknown height.

The historical scope gives context to each issue discussed and allows the reader to understand how each topic has evolved over the course of American history. The authors use qualitative data to help explain socioeconomic issues and connect related topics. Each chapter examines major concepts, so readers can see how an individual&#x2019;s success in stratified settings often relies heavily on their access to valued resources&#x2013;types of capital which involve finances, schooling, social networking, and cultural competence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyzing the impact of capital types throughout the text helps map out the prospects for individuals, families, and also classes to maintain or alter their position in social-stratification systems.</p> <p><strong>Learning Goals</strong></p> <ul> <li>Upon completing this book, readers will be able to:</li> <li>Analyze the four major American classes, as well as how race and gender are linked to inequalities in the United States</li> <li>Understand attempts to reduce social inequality</li> <li>Identify major historical events that have influenced current trends</li> <li>Understand how qualitative sources help reveal the inner workings that accompany people&#x2019;s struggles with the socioeconomic order</li> <li>Recognize the impact of social-stratification systems on individuals and families <br></li></ul></p><p><p>Since the 1970s, <strong>Christopher B.

Unlike many other textbooks on the market, which attempt a faux &#x2018;&#x2018;fair and balanced&#x2019;&#x2019; overview of various &#x2018;&#x2018;theories&#x2019;&#x2019; of stratification that attempt to explain away inequality as an unfortunate by-product of the liberal state or as a problem only of irrational, microlevel discrimination, Doob stakes his claim early on. Briefly noting Davis and Moore&#x2019;s (1945) structural&#x2013;functionalist theory of stratification, he moves quickly through its flaws and takes the reader on a tour de force of more critical perspectives: from Marxist critiques, Weberian &#x2018;&#x2018;iron cages,&#x2019;&#x2019; Mills&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;power elite&#x2019;&#x2019; to Dye&#x2019;s institutional elite, where he does not dismiss any of the aforementioned perspectives but honestly shows how each shines light on a different aspect of capital, labor, and our major social structures.</p><b><i> </i><p><i>Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society</i> is an excellent book for those looking to introduce young readers to the paradoxes, contradictions, and human suffering inherent in the capitalist enterprise.</p></b> <p>Matthew W.

This is rich, timely, and sobering historical fare written in a measured, non-sensationalist style by a master of his craft. One only hopes (almost certainly vainly) that today&#x2019;s policymakers take its lessons to heart.&#x201d;&#x2014;Brian Fagan, <i>Los Angeles</i><i> Times</i>&nbsp;<br><br>Published in 2002, <i>Deforesting the Earth </i>was a landmark study of the history and geography of deforestation.

Surveying ten thousand years to trace human-induced deforestation&#x2019;s effect on economies, societies, and landscapes around the world, <i>Deforesting the Earth </i>is the preeminent history of this process and its consequences.&nbsp;<br><br>Beginning with the return of the forests after the ice age to Europe, North America, and the tropics, Michael Williams traces the impact of human-set fires for gathering and hunting, land clearing for agriculture, and other activities from the Paleolithic age through the classical world and the medieval period. He then focuses on forest clearing both within Europe and by European imperialists and industrialists abroad, from the 1500s to the early 1900s, in such places as the New World, India, and Latin America, and considers indigenous clearing in India, China, and Japan.&nbsp; Finally, he covers the current alarming escalation of deforestation, with our ever-increasing human population placing a potentially unsupportable burden on the world&#x2019;s forests.</p><p><b>Michael Williams</b> is emeritus professor of geography and the environment at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Oriel College.

These characteristics make the method attractive to musicians with a wide variety of cultural backgrounds, interests and skill levels. The method is comprised of two parts: A first section regarding strumming techniques and a second section regarding melodic plucking techniques. The first section provides a clear and precise method for learning the &#34;rasgueo&#34; &#34;repique&#34; and &#34;tremolo&#34; skills central to the Charango repertoire. The second section, meanwhile, provides an indispensable guide to expressive techniques for embellishing melodic lines including hammer-ons and pull-offs, trills, simultaneous melodies and arpeggios. The method is also appropriate for a wide range of musical skill levels, from beginners to accomplished Charanguists who want to improve their technical chops. Exercises are clear and progressive. In the event that the student is not familiar with music theory, an appendix clarifies the basics of musical notation. In addition to 201 written exercises for the Charango solo, the method includes 23 South American folk music classics arranged for Charango and guitar accompaniment. It thus serves as both a pedagogical tool and a source of performance repertoire. The musical scores included in the method are accompanied by a a free audio download of repertoire played by recognized Chilean instrumentalists.</p><p></p><h2>Pattern Theory: From Representation to Inference (Oxford Studies in Modern European Culture)</h2><p><em>Pattern Theory</em> provides a comprehensive and accessible overview of the modern challenges in signal, data, and pattern analysis in speech recognition, computational linguistics, image analysis and computer vision.

Additional resources including extended proofs, selected solutions and examples are available on a companion website.<br>The book commences with a short overview of pattern theory and the basics of statistics and estimation theory. Chapters 3-6 discuss the role of representation of patterns via condition structure. Chapters 7 and 8 examine the second central component of pattern theory: groups of geometric transformation applied to the representation of geometric objects. Chapter 9 moves into probabilistic structures in the continuum, studying random processes and random fields indexed over subsets of Rn. Chapters 10 and 11 continue with transformations and patterns indexed over the continuum. Chapters 12-14 extend from the pure representations of shapes to the Bayes estimation of shapes and their parametric representation. Chapters 15 and 16 study the estimation of infinite dimensional shape in the newly emergent field of Computational Anatomy.

In many ways the paper &#39;The Proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English&#39; (commonly abbreviated PTQ) represents the culmination of Montague&#39;s efforts to apply the techniques developed within mathematical logic to the semantics of natural languages, and indeed it is the system outlined there that people generally have in mind when they refer to &#34;Montague Grammar&#34;. (We prefer the term &#34;Montague Semantics&#34; inasmuch as a grammar, as conceived of in current linguistics, would contain at least a phonological component, a morphological component, and other subsystems which are either lacking entirely or present only in a very rudi� mentary state in the PTQ system. ) Montague&#39;s work has attracted increasing attention in recent years among linguists and philosophers since it offers the hope that semantics can be characterized with the same formal rigor and explicitness that transformational approaches have brought to syntax. Whether this hope can be fully realized remains to be seen, but it is clear nonetheless that Montague semantics has already established itself as a productive para� digm, leading to new areas of inquiry and suggesting new ways of conceiving of theories of natural language. Unfortunately, Montague&#39;s papers are tersely written and very difficult to follow unless one has a considerable background in logical semantics.</p><p></p><h2>Planning to Win: Effective Preparation</h2><p>Beginning practitioners and experienced litigators alike will appreciate this comprehensive look at the practice, rules, strategies, tactics, techniques and theories of preparing and presenting a case for trial.<br></p><p></p><h2>Luther&#39;s Works, Volume 69 (Sermons on the Gospel of John 17-20) (Luther&#39;s Works (Concordia))</h2><p>About this Volume: Volumes 22-24 of Luther's Works: American Edition did not give us all of Luther's preaching on the Gospel of John. Now, in the new volume 69, we have Luther's exposition of Jesus' high priestly prayer in John 17, as well as his preached meditations on the entire passion and resurrection of our Lord according to John. In LW 69, Luther is an expert guide through the mysteries of Lent and Easter. Dr. Christopher Boyd Brown's introductions and footnotes in many ways surpass the scholarly apparatus of the old series. Brown sets Luther's commentary in the context of patristic, medieval, and contemporary Reformation commentaries on John in order to show what was most important to Luther as he preached on Christ's passion.<br><br>The last part of the new volume is truly unique. For the first time, we have collected and translated all of Luther's sermons on John 20:19-31, where Jesus breathes on His disciples, gives them the Holy Spirit, and bestows on them His authority to forgive and retain sins. This passage, which is quoted and explained in many editions of the Small Catechism, as well as in the twenty-eighth article of the Augsburg Confession, has been the center of not a little controversy over the years. The sermons here in LW 69 show in what ways Luther's explanation of this passage changed through his career, and in what ways it stayed the same. In every sermon Luther's concern to uphold the forgiveness of sins through the word of absolution is clear and heartening.<br><br>About the Series: The twenty planned new volumes are intended to reflect both modern and sixteenth-century interests and to expand the coverage of genres underrepresented in the existing volumes, such as Luther's sermons and disputations. The primary basis for the translation is the comprehensive Weimar edition.</p><p></p><h2>My First White Friend: Confessions on Race, Love and Forgiveness</h2><p><b><i>God help me.

From childhood, Molly was taught by her charismatic, demanding mother that "family is everything." But in what seems like an instant, Molly discovers that family can change without warning. Her husband of more than twenty years leaves her for a younger woman, her domineering mother dies, and her Atlanta clan scatters to the four winds. In a heartbeat Molly is set adrift. </p><p>Devasting by her crumbling world, Molly takes refuge with a friend on Martha's Vineyard where she tries to come to terms with who she really is. After the summer season, Molly decides to stay on in this very different world, renting a small cottage on a remote up-island pond.</p><p>As Molly's stay up island widens the distance between her and her old life in Atlanta, she lets go of her outworn notions of family and begins to become part of a strange -- and very real -- new family. As the long Vineyard winter closes in, she braces herself for the search for renewal, identity, and strength, until the healing spring finally comes.</p></p><p><i>Up Island</i> chronicles the mass redemption of a unlikely group, thrown together by the vicissitudes of love and fate: "a six foot Southern Betrayed Wife and her widowed father and a senile old Portuguese lesbian and a one-legged schoolteacher and a mongrel dog and two aberrant swans..." As the novel begins, newly divorced Molly Redwine is in the market for some redemption. Battered and numb from loss, she comes to Martha's Vineyard to escape and heal if she can. For the next 300 pages, the story shuttles between Molly's heart, packed with pain, regret, and guilt, and the sea-licked open spaces of the island. By book's end, both places are terra cognita. There are family secrets, haunted dreams, and enough death to do Shakespeare proud--balanced delicately with small pleasures, kindness, and unbreakable bonds. <i>Up Island</i> is a fractal of a book: complicated but ultimately satisfying as only the completion of a pattern can be. Intelligent and insightful, it is good story tenderly told.<p>Anne Rivers Siddons's bestselling novels include <em>Nora, Nora</em>; <em>Sweetwater Creek</em>; <em>Islands</em>; and <em>Fox's Earth</em>.

Poet Jack Ridl uses remarkably clear and precise language to express a singular awareness of the world around us. Some of the poems in this volume deal with the universal human experience of loss, others discover a fresh perspective on what is easily overlooked, and many seek the goodness and joy that remain in a challenging world. Poems are grouped into chapters by mathematical themes, suggesting a commonality in these two separate worlds that is often overlooked. The straightforward language and universal subject matter make Broken Symmetry a profound collection of poetry that will appeal to readers of all backgrounds.</p><p>Michigan poet Jack Ridl leads readers into reflective connection with the everyday world in this unique and enjoyable volume.Jack Ridl is professor of English at Hope College, Holland, Michigan.

A few facts are given about the history of maple syrup and its production, but the emphasis is on how it is done today. Divided into sections, the book begins with the identification of the sugar maple tree, and proceeds step by step through the process of production, ending with ecological concerns about the future of the trees. An attempt is made to personalize the text by introducing the men who run the operation and the family that enjoys the product. There is no index; specific questions require a search through the table of contents. The economic risk and variability in sugaring is not explained, and smaller, one-family operations that abound in the business are not mentioned. For this perspective, see Kathryn Lasky's Sugaring Time (Macmillan, 1983) and Noel Perrin's Amateur Sugar Maker (University Pr of New England, 1986). Burns gives young readers a much needed introduction to the modern way of preparing maple syrup. --Virginia Golodetz, St. Michael's College, Winooski, VT<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Little Witch&#39;s Christmas Book</h2><p>The Little Witch provides suggestions for Christmas parties and directions for making cards, presents, party invitations, and decorations for the house and the Christmas tree</p><p></p><h2>Can You See What I See?: Toys Read-and-Seek: Picture Puzzles to Search and Solve</h2><p>Bestselling author/photographer Walter Wick now offers a new Level 1 reader series with lots of photographic search-and-find fun--especially for beginning readers!<br><br>From the photographer of the bestselling I Spy books and creator of the Can You See What I See? series is a new search-and-find reader chock full of fun!

Each reflects the warmth of a midwestern childhood, a zest for life, and a love of the American language that has never been equaled.<br></p><p>Joyous, humorous, poetic, and always uniquely American, Carl Sandburg&#39;s Rootabaga Stories are an important part of our children&#39;s literary legacy. In inimitable prose, Sandburg created Rootabaga Country-where the railroad tracks go from straight to zigzag, where the pigs have bibs on, and where the Village of Cream Puffs floats in the wind-and populated it with baby balloon pickers, flummywisters, Poker Face the Baboon and Hot Dog the Tiger, the White Horse Girl and the Blue Wind Boy, corn fairies, blue foxes, and many more fanciful characters. Rootabaga Stories, Part One is irrepressible, zany Americana-an anthology to delight admirers of Sandburg&#39;s genius.<p>CARL SANDBURG (1878&#x2013;1967) was twice awarded the Pulitzer Prize, first in 1940 for his biography of Abraham Lincoln and again in 1951 for Complete Poems. Before becoming known as a poet, he worked as a milkman, an ice harvester, a dishwasher, a salesman, a fireman, and a journalist. Among his classics are the Rootabaga Stories, which he wrote for his young daughters at the beginning of his long and distinguished literary career.</p>^No Bio</p><h2>A Woman Without Lies</h2><p><p>An artist in glass and light, Angel has loved with passion and fire -- and learned the true depths of sadness when what she loved was taken from her. When she first meets Miles Hawkins -- a solitary, distant man -- their mutual mistrust seems insurmountable. Hawk has never known what Angel has freely enjoyed, having experienced only cruelty and betrayal from the women in his life. But Angel is willing to risk everything that proud, silent Hawk cannot, as she strives to bring truth and love to a tormented soul who believes in neither. Yet giving her heart again could be a gamble with stakes too high and too painful for her to endure -- for she fears that, by loving Hawk, she will surely lose him.</p></p><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell has more than eighty titles published to date with over twenty-four million copies of her books in print. She lives in the Sierra Nevada Mountains with her husband, with whom she writes novels under a pseudonym. Her favorite activity is exploring the Western United States to find the landscapes that speak to her soul and inspire her writing.</p>Sexual tension abounds as Angel, the survivor of a car wreck that took the life of her fianc and parents, and Hawk, an entrepreneur and woman hater, circle each other, come together, and then part, perhaps forever. All this takes place in the Pacific Northwest, with scenes on the water that are as colorful as the romance. Laural Merlington gives Hawk a male huskiness and Angel vulnerability and determination. Conversations are interrupted by Lowells continual need to inform us just what each character is thinking, but Merlington still manages to keep fanning the sparks. Those who like Lowells stories will want to listen in on this 1985 novel -- and learn about stained-glass-making, as well.

But who made them, and why? This fascinating new history of England&#39;s cathedrals explores a previously unconsidered view of these extraordinary creations: as constantly-changing structures created by a rich brew of ancient rituals, beliefs, personalities and politics - a living window on to the past. Incorporating the latest historical research, Jon Cannon presents a picture of the English cathedrals as above all products of their time, not just great architectural monuments. These were buildings brought alive by the messages encoded in their sculpture - and the miraculous events that were believed to occur within them. Full of personalities, ideas, stories and novel interpretations, here are the cathedrals of England as you may never have considered them before. Handsomely illustrated with specially commissioned photographs and diagrams, including thematic chapters on key aspects and separate essays on every medieval</p><p>Jon Cannon has worked for ten years in the heritage industry, including for the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England, and English Heritage.

He will begin with New Earth itself, talking on its powerful Corporate rulers and equally powerful Guildmasters. Bleys knows that the true road to control of a world is through the hearts of its common people.<br>But within his inner circle is Henry McLean, Soldier of God, and a True Faith-Holder. Henry fears for the soul of his nephew Bleys, and while he guards, he also watches, and judges.<br>And outside Bleys Ahrens's control is Hal Mayne: the one man in all the human worlds who can challenge Bleys for control. For Hal Mayne is the true culmination of the Cycle's grand design. Bleys would give anything to convert Hal Mayne to his purpose, or failing that, to destroy him.</p><p><b>Gordon R. Dickson </b>was the Hugo- and Nebula-winning author of many classics of fantasy and science fiction, most famously the <i>Childe Cycle</i> (also known as the <i>Dorsai</i> series). He died in 2001.<br>Since its beginning in 1959 as a serialization in Astounding Science Fiction, Dickson's award-winning Childe Cycle has reflected the changes in contemporary "space opera." While the early works revealed the author's skill in seamlessly melding plot complications and his deft, journalistic prose, this latest entry deals with more levels of society than did the earlier works as it follows the attempt of Bleys Ahrens and his troupe (including his brother Dahno and his right-hand woman, Antonia Lu) to encourage a grand unification of all worlds. The series has always seemed based on the idea that those who are destined to lead do so while the rest of us are the better for leaving that task to them. Here the "Great Teacher," as Ahrens is often called, and his crew visit various planets, form interplanetary alliances and continue the search for Hal Mayne, the primary hero of the Cycle. Machinations and intrigues abound, including kidnapping, drugging and threats, but Dickson's presentation is so balanced that even readers unfamiliar with Mayne's role in the series may sympathize more with him than with Ahrens-or with Henry MacLean, who joins the troupe while maintaining that the Great Teacher is guided by Satan, a subplot that may develop in future volumes. And so the Cycle rotates on, with this particular spin, often overwrought but never less than interesting. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Disgrace</h2><p>In an novel set in post apartheid South Africa, a fifty two yearold college professor who has lost his job for sleeping with a student tries to relate to his daughter, Lucy, who works with an ambitious African farmer.</p><p></p><h2>Masquerade: Queer Poetry in America to the End of World War II</h2><p><p>Masquerade is the most comprehensive anthology yet published of poetry by American gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered persons. It includes representative poems from more than 100 writers from pre-colonial times to the end of the Second World War. The anthology begins with selections of anonymous texts from the oral traditions of Hawaii and Native America, followed by voodoo chants and cowboy songs (with a few limericks thrown in for good measure). The selections are arranged by the year of the poet&#x2019;s birth and include samplings of poetry by a racially and ethnically diverse group of men and women. Contemporary readers will know the work of some of these poets, such as Gertrude Stein and Walt Whitman. Other poets, such as George Santayana and Adah Isaacs Menken, will be strangers to most.

He lives in New York.Introduction<br><br>Crimes can occur without mystery. Mysteries can occur without crime. Violent and irrevocable actions can destroy lives but bring other lives together in unforeseeable, unimaginable ways.<br> In 1917, in the grim waterfront section called Black Rock, in Buffalo, New York, a forty-three-year-old Hungarian immigrant was murdered in a barroom fight, beaten to death with a poker. A few years later, in a rural community north of Buffalo, another recent immigrant to America, a German Jew, attacked his wife with a hammer and committed suicide with a double- barreled shotgun. Both deaths were alcohol-related. Both deaths were senseless.&#x201d; The men who came to such violent ends, my mother&#x2019;s father and my father&#x2019;s grandfather, never knew each other, yet their deaths precipitated events that brought their survivors together and would continue to have an influence, haunting and obsessive, into the twenty-first century. Families disrupted by violent deaths are never quite healed&#x201d; though they struggle to regroup and redefine themselves in ways that might be called heroic.<br> It&#x2019;s an irony that I owe my life literally to those violent deaths of nearly a century ago, since they set in motion a sequence of events that resulted in my birth, but I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s an irony that, as a writer, I am drawn to such material. There is no art in violence, only crude, cruel, raw, and irremediable harm, but there can be art in the strategies by which violence is endured, transcended, and transformed by survivors. Where there is no meaning, both death and life can seem pointless, but where meaning can be discovered, perhaps even violence can be redeemed, to a degree.<br> I grew up in a rural household in the Snowbelt of upstate New York in a household of family mysteries that were never acknowledged in my presence, and very likely never acknowledged even by the adults who safeguarded them. My father&#x2019;s mother, whose deranged father had blown himself away virtually in front of her, had changed her surname to a seemingly gentile name, renounced her ethnic/religious background, never acknowledged her roots even to her son, and lived among us like one without a personal, let alone a tragic, history. In this she was quintessentially American&#x201d; self-inventing, self-defining. Her life, like the early lives of my parents, seems in retrospect to have sprung from a noir America that&#x2019;s the underside of the American dream, memorialized in folk ballads and blues and in the work of such disparate writers as Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, John Steinbeck, William Faulkner, James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler. It was as if, as a child, I inhabited a brightly lighted space a family household of unusual closeness and protectiveness surrounded by a penumbra of darkness in which malevolent shapes dwelled.<br> The earliest books to cast a spell on me were Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking-Glass, nightmare adventures in the guise of a childhood classic, and Edgar Allan Poe&#x2019;s Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque. Both Carroll and Poe create surreal worlds that seem unnervingly real, like images in a distorting mirror, and both explore mysteries without providing solutions. Why does the Red Queen scream, at the mildest provocation, Off with his head!&#x201d;? Why are hapless creatures in Wonderland and the Looking-Glass world always changing shape? Why does the narrator of The Tell-Tale Heart&#x201d; kill an old man who hasn&#x2019;t harmed him, and in such a bizarre manner? (Crushed and smothered beneath a heavy bed.) Why does the narrator of The Black Cat&#x201d; put out the eye of his pet cat and strangle his wife? Motiveless malignity! Individuals act out of impulse, as if to assure that irrevocable: the violent act and its consequences.<br> Because I grew up in an atmosphere of withheld information a way of defining mystery&#x201d; I can appreciate the powerful attraction of mystery as art: it&#x2019;s the formal, mediated, frequently ingenious and riveting simulacrum of the unexplained in our lives, the haphazard, hurtful, confusing, tragic. A crime or mystery novel is the elaboration of a riddle to which the answer is invariably less gripping than the riddle; a crime or mystery story is likely to be a single, abbreviated segment of the riddle, reduced to a few characters and a few dramatic scenes. It&#x2019;s a truism that mystery readers are likely to be addicts of the genre, no sooner finishing one mystery novel than taking up another, and then another, for the riddle is, while solved,&#x201d; never explained. But it&#x2019;s perhaps less generally known that writers in the genre are likely to be addicts as well, obsessively compelled to pursue the riddle, the withheld informationn, the mystery&#x201d; shimmering always out of reach in this way transforming the merely violent and chaotic into art to be shared with ottttthers in a communal enterprise.<br> Of contemporary mystery/crime writers, no one is more obviously haunted by a violent family past than James Ellroy (see the memoir My Dark Places), which accounts for the writer&#x2019;s compulsion to revisit, in a sense, the scene of the original crime (the unsolved murder of his mother) though it can&#x2019;t account, of course, for the writer&#x2019;s remarkable and audacious talent. In an earlier generation, Ross Macdonald is the preeminent example of the mystery/detective novelist whose carefully plotted narratives move both backward and forward, illuminating past, usually family, secrets as a way of solving a case in the present. Michael Connelly&#x2019;s isolato L.A. homicide detective Harry Bosch, as the son of a murdered woman, is temperamentally drawn to cold-case files, as are the haunted characters of Dennis Lehane&#x2019;s most celebrated novel Mystic River and the narrator of his brilliantly realized short story Until Gwen,&#x201d; included in this volume. Walter Mosley&#x2019;s Easy Rawlins is a private eye&#x201d; in a racially turbulent, fastidiously depicted Los Angeles milieu of past decades in which the personal intersects, often violently, with the political. In this volume Louise Erdrich&#x2019;s beautifully composed Disaster Stamps of Pluto&#x201d; is, in its most distilled form, a whodunit&#x201d; of uncommon delicacy and art, set in a nearly extinct North Dakota town in which the past exerts a far more powerful gravitational pull than the present. Edward P. Jones&#x2019;s Old Boys, Old Girls&#x201d; is the life story of a man so marginalized and detached from his feelings that he seems to inhabit his life like a ghost, or a prisoner. (See Jones&#x2019;s remarkable story collection Lost in the City for further portrayals of young lions&#x201d; like Caesar Matthews.) In the unexpectedly ironic The Last Man I Killed,&#x201d; David Rachel explores a Nazi past as it impinges on a banal and utterly ordinary academic career in a midwestern state university.<br> While mystery novels are readily available to the public in bookstores and libraries, mystery stories are relatively hidden from view. Only a very few magazines regularly publish them Ellery Queen&#x2019;s Mystery Magazine and Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s Mystery Magazine come most immediately to mind; the majority of mystery stories are scattered among dozens of magazines and literary reviews with limited circulations. The inestimable value of The Best American Mystery Stories series is that the anthologies bring together a selection of stories in a single volume, with an appendix listing additional distinguished titles. While guest editors for the series appear for one year only, the series editor, Otto Penzler, remains a stable and galvanizing presence; any mystery volume with Penzler&#x2019;s name on it is likely to be very good indeed, as well as a responsible and generous representation of the current mystery scene.<br> Though the twenty stories in this selection are all mysteries,&#x201d; the resemblances among them end just about there. Not one seems to me formulaic in the stereotypical way often charged against mystery fiction by people like the critic Edmund Wilson (see Wilson&#x2019;s famously peevish diatribe of 1945, Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?,&#x201d; an attack on the overplotted, psychologically superficial English-cozy whodunits by Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, et al.). Not one evokes violence gratuitously, in the way of contemporary crime/action movies and video games. Not one is, in fact, driven by plot at the expense of probability and plausibility. These are all stories in which something happens, usually irrevocably, but they are not stories in which what happens&#x201d; is primarily the point. As in Kent Nelson&#x2019;s collectively narrated Public Trouble,&#x201d; which traces the history of an adolescent boy who has committed acts of extreme violence, Oz Spies&#x2019;s uncomfortably intimate The Love of a Strong Man,&#x201d; which tells us how it probably feels to be the publicly identified wife of a notorious serial rapist, and Tim McLoughlin&#x2019;s excursion into an ironic sort of nostalgia, When All This Was Bay Ridge,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s the effect of violence upon others that is the point. As McLoughlin&#x2019;s stunned narrator is asked: Who owns memory?&#x201d; The expediency of ethics among professionals in this case, police officers that so shocks McLoughlin&#x2019;s protagonist is the revelation of Lou Manfredo&#x2019;s Case Closed&#x201d; with its street wisdom: There is no right. There is no wrong . . . There just is.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s usually claimed that short stories are distilled, sleeker, and faster-moving forms of fiction than novels, but in fact, all that one can safely say about most stories is that they are shorter than most novels. Page for page, paragraph for paragraph, sentence for sentence, some of the stories in this volume move far more deliberately, if not more poetically, than many novels: David Means&#x2019;s elliptical Sault Ste. Marie&#x201d; is aptly titled, for its setting is its most powerfully evoked character; Daniel Orozco&#x2019;s stylishly narrated Officers Weep&#x201d; is a jigsaw puzzle of a story, requiring the kind of attentive reading usually associated with poetry (or postmodernist fiction); StuartM. Kaminsky&#x2019;s The Shooting of John RoyWorth&#x201d; is a fabulist tall tale that switches protagonists when we least expect it; John Sayles&#x2019;s teasingly oblique and cinematic Cruisers&#x201d; tempts us to read too quickly, and forces us to reread; Scott Turow&#x2019;s Loyalty&#x201d; is almost entirely narrated, a tour de force of suspense that uncoils with the dramatic kick of one of Turow&#x2019;s long, densely populated, Chicago-set novels. So far removed from its initial violent act (which occurred forty years before) is Laura Lippman&#x2019;s The Shoeshine Man&#x2019;s Regrets&#x201d; that the story is resolved as a study of character, tenderly and shrewdly reconstructed. Joseph Raiche&#x2019;s One Mississippi&#x201d; is similarly a reconstruction of violence after the fact, entirely absorbed in the mind of a man who has survived his wife, with no present-action drama: somewhere between story and elegy, convincing as a testament of our gun-ridden TV- tabloid culture. Daniel Handler&#x2019;s Delmonico&#x201d; is an artful variation on the locked-room mystery&#x201d; that pays homage to Hollywood noir. Sam Shaw&#x2019;s Reconstruction&#x201d; and Richard Burgin&#x2019;s The Identity Club&#x201d; are sui generis, feats of voice, tone, perspective, and tantalizing irresolution that argue (as Edmund Wilson could not have foreseen) for the elasticity of borders between literary&#x201d; and mystery&#x201d; stories.<br> Another debatable claim is that the short story is likely to be more self-consciously crafted and shaped&#x201d; than the novel. Yet at least two of the most memorable stories in this volume Edward Jones&#x2019;s Old Boys, Old Girls&#x201d; and Scott Wolven&#x2019;s Barracuda&#x201d; defy expectations at virtually every turn, as willfully shapeless as life. Old Boys, Old Girls&#x201d; meanders like a river over a period of many years, following a vague and haphazard chronological movement; Wolven&#x2019;s much shorter story cuts from scene to scene with the nervous energy of a hand-held camera. Equally memorable stories by Wolven have appeared in the last several volumes of The Best American Mystery Stories, each an exploration of violence among men who have become marginalized, and thus as dangerous as rogue elephants, in an economically ravaged society that places little value on traditional masculinity. For Wolven&#x2019;s men loggers, tree poachers, corrupt cops the impulse to do terrible damage to one another is as natural as watching pit bulls tear one another to pieces for sport.<br> George V. Higgins (1939 1999) was a unique talent. His most acclaimed novel The Friends of Eddie Coyle (1972) has become an American crime classic. As guest editor of this anthology I&#x2019;m grateful to have the opportunity to reprint what will probably be the last of Higgins&#x2019;s stories to appear in this series. One might debate whether Jack Duggan&#x2019;s Law&#x201d; is a story or a novella, but one can&#x2019;t debate the verve, wit, authenticity, and wisdom of the world it memorializes: a Boston demimonde of harassed, overworked, yet quixotically zealous defense attorneys and ADAs. Higgins&#x2019;s ear for the rough poetry of vernacular speech has never been sharper than in this posthumously published story from a collection titled The Easiest Thing in the World.<br> As a concluding note, I should add that reading stories for this volume was a pleasure and that decisions were not easy to make. Both Otto and I read and reread. (I&#x2019;ve read Jack Duggan&#x2019;s Law&#x201d; at least three times. It keeps getting better.) Each of us had the idea, I think, of wearing the other down by stubbornly clinging to favored titles. In some cases this worked, in others not. Where we couldn&#x2019;t finally agree, we decided to include the story in question. Our principal disagreement was over George V. Higgins: Otto preferred the even longer The Easiest Thing in the World&#x201d; to Jack Duggan&#x2019;s Law.&#x201d; In this instance, Otto graciously deferred to me, but readers may want to decide their own preferences.<br><br>Copyright � 2005 by Houghton Mifflin Company.

Timber-framed buildings catch the imagination of those who work with them because of their beauty, their strength and the quality of the material of which they were made: English oak. Many thousands of buildings of all ages still remain to remind us the strength of the tradition. This book looks behind the commong image of &#39;black and white&#39; houses, showing how timber buildings were built and how they vary from region to region.</p><p>Richard Harris spent his first day as an architectural assistant surveying a medieval timber-framed building and has been fascinated ever since. After training at the Architectural Association in London, he worked on research and reconstruction projects at Avoncroft Museum of Buildings and since 1975 he has been based at the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum, Singleton, West Sussex, where he is Director.&#39;... the best general book on (England&#39;s) timber-framed buildings. Written and beautifully illustrated by Richard Harris, the book is not just essential for those interested in the subject, but because of the detail of the drawings, is invaluable for any architect involved in repairing or moving a timber-framed building.&#39; Architects Journal &#39;Richard Harris has made a masterly job of his contributionto the series.

Contained between these covers are no fewer than 600 photographs and illustrations displaying more than 700 examples of fine art deco wares with sparkling metal finishes, including table decorations, drinking service pieces, buffet service items, smoking articles, and lamps. These items were the products of large, well known firms such as Chase, Manning-Bowman, Kensington, and Revere. Histories of the firms and the industrial designers who created these objects, along with patent and design information on many of the illustrated wares, are provided as well. Also included in this thorough text are all of the details necessary to identify art deco design, differentiate between-and care for-a variety of metal finishes, and to determine value. Values are included in the captions for the items shown. A bibliography and an appendix listing the Chase giftware items designed by Harry Laylon round out the presentation.</p><p>Jim Linz has been a weekend collector of art deco for nearly 25 years. Over the years, he has amassed a collection now totaling nearly 1,000 items. Following his retirement from the United States General Accounting Office, Jim has turned his full attention to the pursuit of his hobby. This is the first of several books he plans on art deco. A 1969 graduate of Atlanta&#39;s Emory University, Jim spent more than 27 years auditing federal programs for the GAO before taking early retirement in 1997. As an Assistant Director in GAO&#39;s Health and Human Services Division, he helped produce over 200 reports and testimonies on such diverse subjects as food, cosmetic, drug, and pesticide safety. Medicare and Medicaid fraud, the future of the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system, and health care reform. He was a frequent witness at Congressional hearings. In noting his retirement from public service in September 1997, the Assistant Comptroller General for Human Resources commented that Linz&#39;s work had resulted in &#34;billions of dollars in savings.&#34;</p><h2>Complete Poems (American Poetry Recovery Series)</h2><p><p>Containing more than three hundred poems, including nearly a hundred previously unpublished works, this unique collection showcases the intellectual range of Claude McKay (1889-1948), the Jamaican-born poet and novelist whose life and work were marked by restless travel and steadfast social protest. McKay's first poems were composed in rural Jamaican creole and launched his lifelong commitment to representing everyday black culture from the bottom up. Migrating to New York, he reinvigorated the English sonnet and helped spark the Harlem Renaissance with poems such as "If We Must Die." After coming under scrutiny for his communism, he traveled throughout Europe and North Africa for twelve years and returned to Harlem in 1934, having denounced Stalin's Soviet Union. By then, McKay's pristine "violent sonnets" were giving way to confessional lyrics informed by his newfound Catholicism.</p><p>McKay's verse eludes easy definition, yet this complete anthology, vividly introduced and carefully annotated by William J.

McKay is a hugely important figure in the development of Carribean and African American poetry, and bringing his poems together in one place does an invaluable service to readers of all backgrounds. Maxwell&#39;s outstanding introduction is the most insightful and cogent critical assessment of McKay&#39;s poetry to date.&#34;</p><h2>Fossils of Florissant</h2><p>The most diverse fossil bed in the United States provides a unique picture of what life was like 34 million years ago. In the rocks of Florissant, Colorado, lying in the shadow of Pike's Peak, is the evidence of a long-lost world. Encased by the ash of volcanoes that erupted tens of millions of years ago, animals such as insects, fish, and mammals were fossilized in the same deposits as flowers, trees, and the delicate leaves of plants. This amazing collection of animals and plants from the same place at the same time providse a rare, uniquely comprehensive glimpse of life in the past.<br><br>Through more than 200 color photographs and vivid descriptions of the fossils, Herbert Meyer brings the fossils of Florissant, Colorado to life, not only providing background on the plants and animals, but also exploring the warm environment in which they lived. The site was once a treasure trove for paleontologists who acquired the fossils for museums around the world; it is now protected as Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument. Meyer&#x2019;s book reveals the beauty of both the site and its delicate fossils, and offers a compelling story of life long ago.</p><p><b>Herbert W.

For the besieged American defenders of Bastogne, time was running out....</b><br><br>Hitler&#x2019;s forces had pressed in on the small Belgian town in a desperate offensive designed to push back the Allies, starting the Battle of the Bulge. So far the U.S. soldiers had managed to repel waves of attackers and even a panzer onslaught.

But blazing a trail into Belgium meant going up against some of the best infantry and tank units in the German Army.

The U.S. Army in Europe sustained 77,726 casualties in December, and incurred a further 69,119 casualties in January. In December, 15,333 soldiers and airmen lost their lives, and January was not much better: An additional 12,190 soldiers and airmen perished. In total, in those two months our country sustained 146,845 casualties, and of those, 27,523 were deaths. Most of those occurred in that forty-day period when Germany and the United States were locked in the largest battle of the Western Front.</p><p>In contrast, in July 1863, the month of Gettysburg and Vicksburg, our country, both North and South, suffered 120,426 casualties combined. In fifty-one days, from May through June 1864, when the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse, and Cold Harbor raged, the butcher&#x2019;s bill was 146,046 casualties. The only other bloodletting that came close to the Bulge&#x2019;s total was during the forty-seven days of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in October and November 1918, when the U.S. Army Expeditionary Force lost 122,063 men, and of those, 26,277 were deaths.</p><p>In short, the Battle of the Bulge was truly a national sacrifice, on par with the battles of Gettysburg and the Meuse-Argonne. Citizens of Belgium and Luxembourg still remember our sacrifice and annually commemorate the events of those dark days.Yet many of our own students know little about the Bulge. Their lack of historical appreciation is the number one reason why I chose this subject.</p><p>Yet it is not the only reason. The Bulge and the Siege of Bastogne are also compelling stories. When Don Cygan and I decided to publish <i>No Silent Night: The Christmas Battle for Bastogne</i>, I already had planned to write the sequel, because the story about Bastogne is a two-part saga. The most popular is the account about the 101st Airborne Division and its epic defense of the city. However, every story about a besieged force usually has two armies involved: the besieged and the forces sent to relieve them. Now is the time to tell the tale of Patton&#x2019;s 4th Armored Division and their race to relieve the paratroopers and glider men of the 101st.</p><p>Like <i>No Silent Night</i>, <i>Patton at the Battle of the Bulge</i> provides a German viewpoint to contrast with the American perspective. This story follows several German soldiers who fought with the 5th Fallschirmj�ger Division. Contrary to popular myth, not all German soldiers were monsters. In this book are several examples where German soldiers showed remarkable kindness and mercy toward their sworn enemies, the American army. Sadly, there are also examples of brutality, where German soldiers executed innocent Belgian civilians.</p><p>True, Belgian civilians did perish as a result of American bombs, but those bombs were not meant for the hapless civilians hiding in houses and huddling in cellars. Surgical strikes did not exist in 1944 and 1945, because bombings were far less accurate in World War II than they are today. My research revealed several incidents where Allied aircraft even strafed and bombed <i>American</i> tanks instead of German panzers. In the cloud of war, good intentions did not always result in accurate targeting. On the other hand, the Germans did intend to execute civilians.</p><p>Furthermore, this work provides a civilian point of view. For those living in the path of these armies, the days around Christmas were harrowing ones. In many cases, they exhibited as much amazing courage and selfless sacrifice as the soldiers and tankers who fought among them. This book is also a story about them.</p><p>In addition, I dramatize the German operational briefings, turning them into dialogues. I know some purists might balk at that technique, but I want to present an enthralling story, not a dry account. The words in the briefings are almost entirely verbatim from the sources. In many instances, all I added were quotation marks.</p><p><i>Patton at the Battle of the Bulge</i>, like all good books, was a collaborative effort. I made use of several German and local accounts, for which I would like to thank Roland Gaul, who provided them, including several valuable video interviews and letters; Guy Ries and his website on Bigonville. J�rg Herzig also gave me the lengthy account of Conrad Klemment, which proved indispensable in this story. I would like to thank Ivan Steenkiste, who was crucial in supplying me with information about the battles around Chaumont. His website is a treasure trove of information.</p><p>On the American side, I would like to offer my gratitude to several individuals. Jamie Leach, the son of Jimmie Leach, was an excellent resource in regard to his father. His father&#x2019;s 37th Tank Battalion radio logs, complete with notations, were a wealth of information. Rochelle Dwight gave me great material on her father, William Dwight. She still sends me hilarious daily e-mails that make me laugh. I would like to thank Robert T. Murrell, an 80th Infantry Division veteran, who helped me find information on the 318th Infantry Regiment. Andrew Adkins, the archivist for the 80th Infantry Division website, was hugely instrumental in assisting me with personnel records and personal stories from the 318th. I would like to extend my thanks to Chris Bucholtz and Lynn Gamma, who helped me with finding records concerning the 362nd Fighter Group. I would like to thank Doris Davis, an executive officer for the Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge Association. Without her help, I would have never been able to contact countless veterans and their families.</p><p>Most important are the veterans and their families who provided me their accounts via questionnaires, letters, or interviews. The following accounts were invaluable to the story of the 4th Armored Division and their support elements: Roscoe M. Mulvey Jr., Armand Poirier, Bob Shaw, Jim Sanders, William Leaphart, Howard Lipscomb, Irving Heath, George Whitten, Robert Calvert, Matteo Damiano, Michael George, Eugene Wright, John P. Tvrdovsky, the family of Jack Holmes, Albert Gaydos and the Gaydos family, and Raymond Green. A special thanks goes out to Irving Heath, who provided me his personal photo album from the war. In addition to Irving Heath, another special thanks goes out to Robert Riley&#x2019;s family, especially his daughter, Linda Riggs, who provided me several written accounts about his wartime experiences. Of course, one of the most valuable interviews was with retired brigadier general Albin F. Irzyk. I spent several hours speaking with him about his experiences. His memory was as sharp as a tack, and it was a wonderful experience providing him with information on the Germans who fought his unit at Chaumont. His autobiography was also an amazing source of information about the 4th Armored Division.</p><p>In addition to veterans&#x2019; interviews, several researchers and archivists also supported me in this endeavor. I would like to thank Dieter Stenger, who once again translated dozens of German documents into English. I would like to thank Susan Strange and Tim Frank, who spent innumerable hours poring over documents in the National Archives at College Park, Maryland. Without them, I would not have had thousands of valuable primary sources to examine. William Murray was my researcher at the Army Historical Education Center and helped me with the Oscar W. Koch collection, which was essential to the 4th Armored Division story. Megan Harris was my contact at the Library of Congress&#x2019;s Veterans Oral History Project. Her assistance was instrumental in my success. Javier Tome, a specialist on the 653rd Schwere Panzerj�ger Battalion, sent to me some interesting information on the whereabouts of the 653rd, and his contribution helped me answer the question of who attacked Major Albin Irzyk on December 23 in Chaumont.</p><p>I would be remiss if I did not mention Don M. Fox, author of <i>Patton&#x2019;s Vanguard: The United States Army Fourth Armored Division</i>. A good historian always builds on the work of other great historians. Don&#x2019;s book was my introduction to the 4th Armored Division. Though I had known about the 4th Armored, it was always in a supporting role to the 101st. After reading Don&#x2019;s book, I realized how special the 4th Armored Division truly was, and I decided to start where he left off. Furthermore, his personal input helped me clear up several issues. His work was first-rate, and it still is the seminal book on the 4th Armored&#x2019;s impact in the Second World War.</p><p>I would like to thank my agent, George Bick. His excellent advice pointed me in the right direction, and he is a superb sounding board for ideas. I would also like to thank Talia Platz, my editor, who offered me another chance at NAL Caliber. I hope you do not regret it! I cannot forget Brent Howard, who was my second editor at NAL. Thank you for your title ideas. I owe a debt of gratitude to General Dynamics and the U.S. Army Intelligence Center, which continue to employ me as an instructor at the Military Intelligence Officer Transition Course. Thank you for indulging my research pursuits and allowing me to use the same data from my books to teach future military intelligence officers in the United States Army.</p><p>Last, I would like to thank my wonderful wife, Caulyne. No man is an island, and without her support, none of this would have happened. She is the rock in our marriage, and she is my better half.1</p><p></p><p></p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>| 0845 HOURS, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1944 |</p><p>Lead Platoon, Dog Company, <br>8th Tank Battalion, 4th Armored Division, <br>Southern Outskirts of Chaumont, Belgium</p><p>Private Bruce Fenchel knew Christmas was canceled the moment his first sergeant had barged into his room more than ninety-six hours before and announced, &#x201c;Pack your duffel bags and get ready to roll. One man go to the kitchen and take any food you can get.&#x201d;</p><p>Fenchel had been writing a letter to his mother when the sergeant broke the news, and a collective moan arose from the men. <i>So much for R &amp; R</i>, thought Fenchel. Unmoved, the sergeant continued to bark out orders. &#x201c;The rest of you put the machine guns back on your tanks and gas them and be ready to roll in two hours. The Germans have broken through our line in Bastogne, and Eisenhower has ordered General Patton&#x2019;s 4th Armored to immediately head north.&#x201d;</p><p>Twenty-year-old Fenchel could not believe it. His unit, the 8th Tank Battalion, part of the 4th Armored Division, had been locked in combat for months. Now, after more than eighty days on the line, the Eight Ballers were taking a much-needed break. Unfortunately, the Germans had other plans for the holidays. Instead of relaxing for Christmas, Fenchel and the rest of his division were driving back into battle.</p><p>Two years before, Bruce Donald Fenchel thought he was joining the Army Air Force. At his induction center at Camp Dodge, Des Moines, Iowa, he had taken several tests and passed all with flying colors. To his surprise, he learned that instead he was going to Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he would learn to drive a tank. Initially crestfallen, he remembered that his induction center company commander had suggested that he apply to Officer Candidate School and become an infantry officer. Fenchel knew that an infantry officer had a short life span. Tanks seemed a whole lot safer than being a bullet catcher&#x2014;a foot soldier. He decided against the move, and was off to Fort Knox.1Now, Fenchel&#x2019;s 8th Tank Battalion was under the command of a promising young officer, Major Albin F. Irzyk, who like Fenchel was also in his twenties. Irzyk did not waste much time. Receiving the order to move out, he had pushed his battalion onto the roads early on the morning of December 19. All day and night Fenchel and battalion rolled northward from their staging area at Domnom-l�s-Dieuze in Lorraine, France, all the way into Belgium. By the morning of the twenty-third, they had reached a point several kilometers south of the village of Chaumont.</p><p>The 8th Tank Battalion was part of a larger force known as Combat Command B of the 4th Armored Division. A U.S. Armored Division had three combat commands: A, B, and R (Reserve). Each was a combined arms team that usually was comprised of a tank battalion, an armored infantry battalion, a self-propelled artillery battalion, an assortment of engineers, motorized cavalry (jeeps), and other support units. In addition, each command would further divide its force into task forces, cross-loading various infantry units with armor units. Therefore, 8th Tank Battalion had infantry and tanks as it wound its way north to Bastogne that early morning. Their mission: Get to Bastogne and relieve the 101st Airborne Division before the Germans crushed the beleaguered paratroopers.2Despite the importance of the task ahead, Fenchel simply wanted to stay warm and get some sleep. After clearing the town of Burnon during the previous afternoon, the young tank driver had assumed his unit would establish a perimeter for the night and continue their advance the following morning. He was wrong.</p><p>At 1834 hours, the orders came down from Combat Command B Headquarters over the radio: &#x201c;Push onto Checkpoint Forty-four all night.&#x201d;</p><p>A radio operator from another unit asked higher headquarters to confirm the order. It took them only seven minutes to reply: &#x201c;We are moving on CP Forty-four all night. On foot if necessary.&#x201d; Everyone now knew the command was probably coming from the top man himself&#x2014;Lieutenant General George S. Patton.3Patton, the commander of the U.S. Third Army, sensed that the road to Bastogne was open. His army&#x2019;s spearhead was the 4th Armored Division, and leading the 4th was CCB. At the forefront of Patton&#x2019;s entire army was Private Fenchel in his little Stuart tank. So far, the 4th had met only determined resistance near Martelange, several kilometers southeast of Fenchel&#x2019;s current position.4During World War II, armored units rarely conducted operations during hours of limited visibility. Unlike today, troopers back then did not have night-vision goggles. They drove their vehicles almost bumper-to-bumper, their eyes fixed on the slivers of light in front of them emanating from the partially covered headlights. These covered lights, known as &#x201c;cat&#x2019;s eyes,&#x201d; barely gave off enough light for a man to see, and if he fell too far behind, he would lose sight of the vehicle in front of him.</p><p>Major Irzyk, deciding that the more maneuverable Stuarts and jeeps might be better suited to driving at night than the heavier and slower Shermans, ordered a platoon of jeeps from Baker Troop, 25th Cavalry Squadron, followed by a platoon of light tanks from Dog Company, to take the lead. Around 2300 hours, after they had completed their refueling, his battalion resumed their progress northward. It was slow going. Coupled with a lack of sleep, Fenchel had a hard time staying focused on the vehicle in front of him. At one point, he lost sight of the cat&#x2019;s eyes. When he found them again, it was too late, and his tank crashed into the rear of another tank in his platoon. Luckily, no one was hurt and neither vehicle was damaged.5Finally, after several hours they reached a point about a kilometer and a half south of Chaumont. The top of the sun was barely over the eastern horizo...</p></p><h2>Addressed to Kill (A Postmistress Mystery)</h2><p><b>Third in the Postmistress Mystery series by Jean Flowers, following <i>Death Takes Priority</i> and <i>Cancelled by Murder</i>...</b><br><br>Love is in the air for postmaster Cassie Miller and the residents of North Ashcot, Massachusetts.

Individual trees are dying at unprecedented rates, numerous woody species are at risk of extinction and the country's forests are disappearing as intact ecosystems. The devastation stretches across the land and is eerily similar to losses observed in Europe. Although the immediate cause of death varies, Little and the numerous ecologists and foresters whom he interviewed argue convincingly that the best explanation is ultimately the environmental havoc humans have wrought. Acid rain, heavy metal contamination, smog, increased ultraviolet rays streaming through the growing hole in the ozone layer and atrocious management of forests?from clear-cutting to fire suppression?have so weakened individual trees, as well as ecosystems, that once-routine pests may now be responsible for destruction on an unprecedented scale. This book should significantly alter the way we think about our relationship to the natural world. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Caught as we are in a spell of denial and backlash, we're told that environmental concerns have been greatly exaggerated and we no longer need all those pesky laws and regulations. Not so fast says environmental journalist Little, everything is not okay--trees are dying all over the U.S. Little presents the terrible facts about such calamities as the extinction of the eastern dogwood, the toll acid rain has taken on trees from Vermont to North Carolina, and the human-caused plague killing California's ponderosa pine. He also explains how logging and fire prevention alter the composition of forests and lead to such fatal imbalances as the massive increases in regional populations of the tree-killing gypsy moth. Little traces the origins of all these forms of tree death to 150 years of full-throttle industrialization and then firmly reminds us that trees are essential to life on earth as we hope to live it. Sobering, responsible, and eloquent, this is an important book. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Book of Prehistoric Beasts: Colour and Discover (Fantastic Beasts to Colour &amp; Discover)</h2><p><p><b>Delve into history and discover a time when colossal creatures and humongous dinosaurs roamed the earth. </b></p><p>Featuring more than 90 of the most fascinating and ferocious animals that prehistory had to offer, readers can colour in the beguiling beasts and then learn all about them by turning to the back of each page.</p><p><b>Also in the 'Fantastic Beasts to Colour &amp; Discover' series:</b><br>9781780554297 <i>The </i><i>Book of Beasts</i></p></p><p></p><h2>Transformer</h2><p>The story of an unconventional life looks at rock legend Lou Reed, a chamelion-like figure who suffered electroshock therapy to &#34;cure&#34; his homosexuality, toured with Andy Warhol, and led a revolution in rock music. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Bockris, biographer of William S. Burroughs and Andy Warhol, presents a detailed portrait of former Velvet Underground frontman Reed. Born in 1942, the only son and eldest child of a Jewish middle-class family from Long Island, Reed still harbors resentment toward his parents for having raised him in a suburban lifestyle, according to Bockris. An "outsider" fueled by a desire to belong and to control, the singer developed, then destroyed, relationships with his mentor Warhol, former bandmate John Cale and glam-rock superstar David Bowie. A bisexual and former speed addict, Reed is accredited to be the godfather of punk. Though the author relies on too many cliched phrases, he provides insight into the private life that led Reed to create many of rock's memorable songs, including "Heroin" and "Walk on the Wild Side." As a bonus, Bockris concludes with a 1979 episode in New York City when he introduced Reed to Burroughs, an amusing anecdote in which the writer assured the rocker that "it is not very often that a writer will have to actually make it with his publisher in order to get published." <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Although a scant commercial success, the Velvet Underground was, except for the Beatles, probably the most influential 1960s rock band. Unlike the individual Beatles, Velvets leader Lou Reed has remained artistically credible ever since the band broke up, and his recent albums are among his strongest. Chronicling Reed, Bockris evokes the Velvets' downtown-NYC milieu, detailing the pansexual and pharmaceutical hijinks that characterized their music and their lives. Indeed, even covering the period after Reed straightened out and adopted a rigorous work ethic, Bockris digs up intriguing gossip, such as Reed's current affair with performance artist Laurie Anderson. Although it fails to do justice to Reed's dark, compelling music, Bockris' occasionally wretched prose somehow suits Reed's prurience-arousing private life ("Lou had succeeded in bringing [singer Nico] to her once-proud knees" ). Fans will find plenty here to inform their view of the many faces Reed has presented the public during the past 30 years. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Orphism: The Evolution of Non-Figurative Painting in Paris, 1910-1914 (Oxford Studies in the History of Art and Architecture)</h2><p>Hardback book with dust jacket, Oxford Studies in the History of Art and Architecture, 409 pages, 1979, OUP</p><p></p><h2>The Secret of Wilhelm Storitz: The First English Translation of Verne&#39;s Original Manuscript (Bison Frontiers of Imagination)</h2><p>Widely rumored to exist, then circulated in a corrupt form, Jules Verne&#x2019;s final and arguably most daring and hauntingly beautiful novel&#x2014;his own &#x201c;invisible man&#x201d;&#x2014;appears here for the first time in a faithful translation.

It was a time he would later call the &#x201c;most stupendous experience of my life.&#x201d;<br><br> That war ended with Hitler in a hospital bed, temporarily blinded by mustard gas. The world he eventually opened his newly healed eyes to was new and it was terrible: Germany had been defeated, the Kaiser had fled, and the army had been resolutely humbled.<br><br> Hitler never accepted these facts. Out of his fury rose a white-hot hatred, an unquenchable thirst for revenge against the &#x201c;criminals&#x201d; who had signed the armistice, the socialists he accused of stabbing the army in the back, and, most violently, the Jews&#x2015;a direct threat to the master race of his imagination&#x2015;on whose shoulders he would pile all of Germany&#x2019;s woes.<br><br> By peeling back the layers of Hitler&#x2019;s childhood, his war record, and his early political career, Paul Ham&#x2019;s <em>Young Hitler: The Making of the F�hrer&nbsp;</em>seeks the man behind the myth. More broadly, Paul Ham seeks to answer the question: Was Hitler&#x2019;s rise to power an extreme example of a recurring type of demagogue&#x2015;a politician who will do and say anything to seize power; who thrives on chaos; and who personifies, in his words and in his actions, the darkest prejudices of humankind? 16 pages of color and B&amp;W photographs</p><p>Paul Ham&nbsp;is the author of several histories, including Hiroshima Nagasaki and 1914: The Year the World Ended.

He now lives in Paris.&#x201c;A biographical inquiry of disquieting contemporary relevance. As he marvels at the impotence of Hitler&#x2019;s critics to stop his ascent, Ham worries about the rise of populist demagogues in the twenty-first-century world, and he summons his readers to the imperative task of fighting their influence.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (Starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps the greatest contribution of this book in a time of resurgent nationalism is its quiet reminder that Hitler was an all-too-human product of his time who &#x2018;personified the feelings of millions, and still does.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In addition to providing a detailed recounting of Hitler&#x2019;s personal history, Ham also places most events and ideologies of the time into their historical context.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A useful general-audience perspective on Hitler as more drummer than leader.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Ham is a splendid storyteller, a master of engrossing and exciting narrative.

These poems form the contiguous dance of language choosing its own body at will, traveling across light and the dimensions of unarticulated history.

Called Stalag Luft III, the camp soon came to contain some of the most inventive escapers ever known. They were led by Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, code-named &#39;Big X&#39;, who masterminded an attempt to smuggle hundreds of POWs down a tunnel built right under the noses of their guards. The escape would come to be immortalised in the famous film The Great Escape , in which the ingenuity and bravery of the men was rightly celebrated. The plan involved multiple tunnels, hundreds of forged documents, as well as specially made German uniforms and civilian clothing. In this book Guy Walters takes a fresh look at this remarkable event and asks the question, what was the true story, not the movie version? He also examines what the escape really achieved, and the nature of the man who led it. The Real Great Escape is the first account to draw on a newly-released cache of documents from Roger Bushell&#39;s family, including letters from Bushell, that reveals much about this remarkable man, his life and experiences during the war, and the planning of the escape attempt that was to make him famous. The result is a compelling and authoritative re-evaluation of the most iconic escape story of the Second World War.</p><p>Guy Walters is the author of several books on the Second World War, including Hunting Evil. A former journalist on The Times, he writes widely on historical topics for the national press. He lives in Wiltshire with his wife, the author Annabel Venning, and their two children.&#34;Guy Walters strips away the myths to reveal the real story behind the film and finds the truth to be no less thrilling.

As the book opens, Melody notices that her father is distracted&#x2014;burning food, whistling "You Are My Sunshine," and, most concerning, calling someone "Honey." A visit from Teeny Nelson, her six-year-old neighbor, confirms Melody's suspicion that her father has, in Teeny's words, "been bitten by the love bug." Along with her friend, Nick Woo, and a cast of winning supporting characters, Melody sets out to discover "Honey's" identity. At the same time, in passages that may be confusing to younger readers, a dog named Mo has a mystery of his own to solve. He dreams about a girl he knows he's supposed to be with, but first he has to find her. Much of the novel's action takes place in the Bee Hive, a local salon owned by a woman named Bee-Bee Churchill who can fill in the missing pieces of Melody's story&#x2014;and is known for her homemade nail polish. Weeks has a good eye for the details of Melody's life&#x2014;her anxiety about school, her love for her father and grandfather, and her need to learn more about her mother.

He is currently a commentator for FOX Sports' NASCAR coverage. <br><br> Jade Gurss is the bestselling coauthor of Driver #8 with Dale Earnhardt, Jr.Describing a life spent in a NASCAR driver's seat, Waltrip steers a straightforward course from his life as a grade-school go-cart champion through a gifted yet crash-prone upstart driver to 84 NASCAR victories. Full of the same bravado and confidence that made him a natural driver and NASCAR's biggest villain, Waltrip tells his story just as he raced: all out. Though his need to prove his worth still leads him to put his foot in his mouth now and again, more often than not he is candid enough to acknowledge when he was good, bad, scared or dumb. NASCAR fans will have flashbacks when he conjures up his memories of his highs (the 1989 Daytona 500) and lows (crashing three times at Daytona). He does take the time to open up the world of NASCAR to nonfans; he gives an informative overview of NASCAR's growth from some good ol' boys in the South to a sporting and cultural phenomenon that has put down roots in the entire nation. Having been through the sport's formative years, Waltrip (who is now a commentator for Fox NASCAR coverage) also shares stories of some of NASCAR's greats from Petty to Gordon. His feelings about the fans embracing him later in his career and his honesty about his lack of success in his last years behind the wheel spotlights the bittersweet retirement of an athlete who continued past his prime. Appropriately, this strong finish is representative of Waltrip, whose book, like his career, has its ups and down and will end up being embraced by racing fans. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In one corner of the fields a motley bunch of people was digging. Occasionally a head would stick up above the tall grass whenever someone straightened up to stretch out an aching back or change position: a white cap, a straw hat, a pirate's bandanna, long hair that a woman twisted into a coil and held on top of her head for a moment in an attempt to find some relief before she let the tresses fall back over her shoulders. Beyond the bowed backs the shimmering waters of the Baltic were visible as an auspicious blue backdrop. Bumblebees and wasps buzzed among the bright red poppies; the oats rippled gently back and forth as a light breeze drifted past. Otherwise the air was practically motionless. A high-pressure system from Russia had moved in over Gotland and had remained parked there for a week.Twenty or so archaeology students were methodically excavating what had once been a Viking Age harbor a thousand years in the past. It was hard work that required patience.Martina Flochten from the Netherlands was squatting down in a pit, scraping at stones and earth with a trowel. She was using the small tool eagerly but cautiously so as not to damage any potential finds. Now and then she would pluck out a stone and toss it into the black plastic bucket beside her.Now the fun part had started. After a couple of weeks of fruitless digging, she had finally been rewarded for all her efforts a few days ago. She had found several silver coins and some glass beads. The feeling she got from holding objects that no human being had touched since the ninth or tenth century was just as strong for her every time. It started her imagination going, thinking about how the people inthis place had once lived. What woman had worn these beads? Who was she, and what thoughts had passed through her mind?Martina was one of the foreign participants in the course. Almost half the students came from other countries. There were two Americans, a British woman, a Frenchman, a Canadian whose family had originally come from India, a couple of Germans, and an Australian named Steven. This was part of his around-the-world journey; Steven was traveling to sites of archaeological interest all over the globe. His father was apparently quite wealthy, so Steven could do whatever he pleased. Martina was studying archaeology at the university in Rotterdam, and that's where she had heard about the courses in archaeological fieldwork that were offered by the college in Visby. The course was worth ten college credits, which would be accepted toward her Dutch degree. Martina was also half Swedish: Her mother was from Gotland. Although the family had lived in the Netherlands for Martina's whole life, they often came to the island on vacation, even after her mother died in a car accident three years ago. Having the chance to stay on Gotland for a longer period of time and devote herself to the most interesting work she could imagine was an opportunity she hadn't wanted to miss.So far the training had been beyond her expectations. The participants got along well together. Most of them were her own age, about twenty, although some were older. Bruce, one of the Americans, was in his fifties and kept mostly to himself. He had told them that he worked as a computer technician, but archaeology was what interested him most. And Martina guessed that the British woman was about forty; she seemed rather odd.Martina enjoyed this mixture of the Swedish and the international. The mood of the group was raucous but cordial. Laughter often echoed over the area as the team members joked about each other's digging techniques and varying degrees of success in making finds. So far poor Katja from G�teborg hadn't dug up anything but animal bones, which were plentiful. Her pit seemed to hold nothing else; even so, the job had to be done. So there she sat, day after day, sweating hard without finding anything of interest. Martina hoped that Katja would soon be allowed to try another pit.The excavation course had started off with a couple of weeks devoted to theory in classrooms at the college in Visby. After that cameeight weeks on a dig in Fr�jel on Gotland's west coast. Since Martina was so interested in the Viking Age, nothing could have suited her better. This entire area had probably been inhabited during that period. Various digs had produced finds from the early Viking Age of the ninth century all the way up to the end of the era around 1100. The section of the excavation site where the students were now working included a harbor, a settlement, and several burial grounds. It had also most likely been an important trading center, considering all the weights and silver coins that had been dug up.Suddenly Steven gave a shout from where he was crouching down in the next pit. Everyone went rushing over to him. He was in the process of uncovering the skeleton of a man, and he had found part of what he suspected was a circular brooch made of bronze lying near the man's throat. Staffan Mellgren, the excavation leader, cautiously climbed down into the pit and reached for a small brush that was in a bucket along with other tools. Carefully he began brushing away the dirt, and after several minutes he had uncovered the entire brooch. All the students stood gathered around the pit, watching with fascination as bit by bit the well-preserved brooch came into view. The leader's enthusiasm was infectious."Amazing!" he shouted. "It's all in one piece. The pin is intact, and take a look at the ornamentation."Mellgren switched to using an even smaller brush, and with light strokes he swept away the rest of the dirt. He used the handle of the brush to point at the upper portion of the circular brooch."What you see here was used to hold the inner shift in place--the thinner garment that he wore next to his skin. If we're in luck, he'll also have a larger circular brooch at his shoulder. It's just a matter of continuing to work."He gave a nod of encouragement to Steven, who looked both happy and proud."Proceed with caution, and don't stand too close to the skeleton. There might be more."The others returned to their work with renewed zeal. The thought that they, too, might find something noteworthy had energized them. Martina kept on digging. After a while it was time to empty the bucket. She went over to one of the big wooden sieves that were lined up alongthe edge of the excavation site. Carefully she poured the contents of her bucket into the sieve, which consisted of a rectangular wooden box with a fine-meshed steel screen in the bottom. It was sitting on top of an iron bar, which made it possible to roll the box back and forth. She grabbed hold of the wooden handles on either side and began shaking the box vigorously to sift out the dirt and sand. It was hard work, and after a few minutes, she was soaked with sweat. After she had strained out the worst of the dirt, she meticulously studied what was left in the sieve so as not to miss anything of value. First she found an animal bone and then another. There was also a tiny metal object, probably a nail.Nothing could be thrown out; everything had to be carefully preserved and documented since no one would be allowed to dig there after them. Once a site had been excavated, it was considered "disturbed" forever after; that was why archaeologists had such a big responsibility to preserve everything that might reveal how human beings had lived in that particular area.Martina had to take a break for a few minutes. She was thirsty and went to get her knapsack with her water bottle. She sat down on an upended wooden box, massaging her shoulders as best she could and watching the others as she caught her breath. Her teammates were focused on their work, kneeling, squatting, or lying on their stomachs alongside pits, tenaciously searching through the dark soil.She felt Mark's eyes on her but pretended not to notice. Her feelings were engaged elsewhere, and she didn't want to encourage him. They were good friends, which was enough as far as she was concerned.Jonas, a likable guy from Sk�ne who wore an earring and a pirate's bandanna on his head, saw that she was giving herself a massage."Are your shoulders sore? Do you want me to rub them?""Sure, thanks," said Martina in clumsy Swedish. She knew a little of her late mother's peculiar language, and she wanted to get some practice, even though she and everyone around her spoke fluent English.Jonas was one of her best friends in the group; they got on well together. She appreciated his offer, even though she sensed that it wasn't purely out of concern for her well-being. The attention that certain men in the group paid to her was nice, but not something she especially encouraged.THE INNER CIRCLE.

As Captain Kirk returns home in sadness, he recalls the first time he held Gary's life in his hands: Seven years earlier, the two men have been assigned to the U.S.S. <i>Constitution,</i> Gary as chief navigator and Kirk as second officer, when the starship comes to the defense of an alien world menaced by ruthless invaders. An early attack leaves both the captain and the first officer in comas, and Jim Kirk must take command for the first time. He finds himself with only one chance to defeat the heavily armed enemy -- but the cost may be Gary Mitchell's life!</p><p>Michael Jan Friedman is the author of nearly sixty books of fiction and nonfiction, more than half of which bear the name <i>Star Trek</i> or some variation thereof. Ten of his titles have appeared on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list. He has also written for network and cable television, radio, and comic books, the <i>Star Trek: Voyager�</i> episode &#x201c;Resistance&#x201d; prominent among his credits. On those rare occasions when he visits the real world, Friedman lives on Long Island with his wife and two sons.<b>Chapter One</b><br>Security Officer Scott Darnell would have preferred to go to the funeral. As it was, it had fallen to him to stand watch in the <i>Enterprise's</i> monitor-studded security section, overlooking the ship's internal sensor net and guarding her phaser stores.<br>Hardly anyone ever visited security unless he himself was a security officer. So when the door slid aside to admit First Officer Spock, Darnell was a little surprised. Then he saw the phaser rifle cradled in the Vulcan's arms and he understood.<br>Spock had commandeered the rifle shortly after the <i>Enterprise</i> established orbit around Delta Vega. Darnell hadn't been on duty at the time, but the inventory file showed the incident clearly enough.<br>What it didn't show was why the first officer had needed the weapon. As far as Darnell or most anyone else knew, they had only made a stop at Delta Vega to obtain the hardware they required to repair their warp drive. The planetoid being completely unoccupied, it didn't seem a phaser rifle would be of much utility to anyone there.<br>Nonetheless, Spock had taken the weapon and beamed down with it. And sometime after that, something terrible had happened on Delta Vega -- something, it seemed, which wasn't entirely unexpected, or why bring down a rifle in the first place?<br>When it was over, three of the crew had died. One was Gary Mitchell, the primary navigator. The second was Elizabeth Dehner, a psychiatrist who had joined the <i>Enterprise</i> only recently. And the third was Lee Kelso, the man whose funeral Darnell was missing.<br>But that was all the security officer knew. In fact, that was all anyone knew. The captain had classified the matter, prohibiting all those who had beamed down to Delta Vega from speaking of it.<br>It didn't seem fair to Darnell -- especially when people had lost their lives down there. But that was the way it was, and there was nothing he or any of his colleagues could do about it.<br>"Mr. Spock," he said as the Vulcan approached. "I guess you're returning that rifle now."<br>"Indeed," Spock replied, handing it over.<br>Darnell took a quick look at the weapon. It had a few dinks, but otherwise appeared to be in good condition. Then, just out of habit, he checked to see if there was any charge left.<br>He was confused. What's more, he said so.<br>"Why is that?" the Vulcan inquired, his lean visage characteristically devoid of emotion.<br>"Well," the security officer explained, "I figured with all that happened down there -- whatever that might have been -- someone would have had occasion to squeeze off a few shots."<br>Spock cocked an eyebrow. "There are two possibilities, Mr. Darnell. Either the rifle was fired and someone recharged it, perhaps to avoid any official record of its having been employed on Delta Vega...or contrary to your expectations, it never was fired. However, as the matter is now classified, I do not believe it is appropriate to speculate either way."<br>With that, the first officer turned and departed, leaving the security officer with the fully charged rifle in his hands. Darnell grunted. Then he got up from his seat among the security monitors and headed for the ordnance locker to put the rifle back where it belonged.<br><i>Vulcans,</i> he thought. <i>Why can't they just say what they mean?</i><br><br>Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu knelt in the <i>Enterprise's</i> botany lab, a place of vibrant colors and exotic scents, and contemplated the Mandreggan moonblossoms he had been cultivating.<br>Their large, fragile-looking petals were a pale yellow at the center, fading to white and then deepening into a lush scarlet at the edges. They were breathtakingly beautiful. Even First Officer Spock had remarked on their appearance, and he seldom remarked on anything that didn't pertain to the ship's operation.<br>No one had believed that he could grow moonblossoms in an artificial environment. After all, no starship botanist had ever done it before. But he accomplished it anyway.<br>After all, Sulu was the kind of man who did what he set out to do. When he was a teenager, he had set his sights on attending Starfleet Academy and earned himself a place at that prestigious institution. And when he had made the decision to specialize in astrophysics, he landed a berth on one of the most prestigious vessels in the fleet.<br>In fact, in all his twenty-seven years, he had never failed to obtain something he really wanted. So why had it been so difficult for him to go after the thing he had come to desire lately?<br>Of course, the astrophysicist knew the answer to that question. After all, life was good on the <i>Enterprise.</i> He had comforts here he had grown used to, friends he wouldn't look forward to giving up.<br>But as Sulu's grandfather once told him, "Observe the wisdom of the shark, Hikaru. It knows that if it stops swimming, it stops breathing. So it continues to swim."<br>Like the shark they had seen at the aquarium that day, he would continue to swim. But that didn't make it any easier to abandon the life he had made for himself there.<br>"Hikaru?" came a voice.<br>Sulu looked up and saw two of his fellow crewmen standing at the entrance to the botany lab. One was Daniel Alden, the ship's primary communications officer. The other was Joe Tormolen, a lieutenant in engineering. It was Tormolen who had called his name.<br>"Come on," he said.<br>"It's time," Alden added.<br>Knowing seats would be at a premium at the funeral service, Sulu nodded and got to his feet. "Just saying goodbye to some of my friends," he explained as he joined the others.<br>"I know the feeling," said the communications officer.<br>Sulu smiled wistfully. "That's right. I guess you would."<br>Together, they left the botany lab and headed for the <i>Enterprise's</i> chapel. And when they got there, Sulu thought, he would be saying goodbye to another friend. He would miss Lee Kelso, he reflected.<br>He would miss them all.<br><br>Captain James T. Kirk entered the <i>Enterprise's</i> small, spartan chapel, with its silver-blue walls and its neatly arranged rows of chairs and its lonely, red-orange lectern. Looking around, he scanned the solemn faces of the crewmen who had already arrived for the noontime service.<br>There must have been a hundred of them, from every section of the ship and every deck, representing every rank and every species in the Fleet, all gathered to pay their respects to a man they had valued and loved and admired. And if there weren't enough chairs in the place for nearly a third of those in attendance, that didn't seem to daunt them any.<br>Kelso would have been touched by the size of the turnout, Kirk thought. Touched and more than a little amazed.<br>In one corner of the room, Montgomery Scott, the chief engineer, was speaking wistfully with Lieutenant Tormolen and Ensign Beltre, no doubt recounting some fond remembrance of the dead man. In another corner, Yeoman Smith and Lieutenant Alden were commiserating over their loss with Lieutenant Sulu of astrophysics. And in still another corner, Chief Medical Officer Piper was exchanging stoic looks with Lieutenant Dezago and Nurse Chapel.<br>Several other crewmen had asked to attend also, but regulations required a full complement of specialists to operate the Constitution-class vessel. That was especially true on the bridge, where Ensign Green had taken over the helm controls, Lieutenant Brent had moved to navigation, Lieutenant Farrell was manning the communications console, and Lieutenant Commander Spock, the <i>Enterprise's</i> Vulcan first officer, had assumed temporary command of the ship.<br>"Captain," said Scott, noticing Kirk's entrance. He approached his commanding officer. "We've been waitin' for ye, sir."<br>The captain nodded, adjusting the plastiform cast Piper had given him to help his wrist injury heal. "Sorry I'm late, Scotty. Something came up at the last minute."<br>The engineer looked at him suspiciously. "If I may ask, sir, what sort of something was it?"<br>Kirk smiled at him, knowing the pride the man took in his work. "Just a little trouble with the plasma manifold. But from what I'm told, it can wait until the service is over."<br>Scott's features puckered into a frown. "Are ye sure, sir? If ye like, I could take a moment t' -- "<br>The captain held up his good hand to restrain the engineer. "Quite sure, Scotty. We've kept everyone waiting long enough."<br>Scott nodded dutifully. "As ye say, sir."<br>In the thirteen months since Kirk had taken command of the <i>Enterprise,</i> he had used the ship's chapel to hold five weddings, an Iltrasian coming-of-age ceremony, and only one funeral -- that of a young lieutenant named Henry George Beason, who had been killed in the weapons room when it took a hit from an Orion mercenary.<br>Of course, Beason wasn't the only casualty of Kirk's stint as commanding officer, or even the first. However, the captain hadn't conducted services for the fourteen who had died previously. It was only customary to do so when a crewman lacked family and friends planetside.<br>Beason's only surviving relative had been a maiden aunt in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, who was too feeble to leave her house, much less attend any kind of funeral for her nephew. As a result, the captain had arranged a service for the man on the <i>Enterprise.</i><br>Unfortunately, the situation was a similar one today. The deceased was an orphan, a man who had been raised in an institution outside Los Angeles. The only people he really cared about -- and the only people who cared about him -- were his fellow crew men. It was only fitting that his death be marked by a service aboard the ship.<br>Finding a seat in the front row, Kirk found himself flanked by security officers Matthews and Rayburn on one hand and Lieutenant Stiles on the other. Stiles, a severe-looking man who had shown himself to be an efficient officer, turned to the captain.<br>"Sir," he said, acknowledging Kirk's presence.<br>"Stiles," Kirk said in return.<br>"Hell of a way to go," Stiles remarked. He shook his head. "Choked to death with a cable. Nasty business all around."<br>The captain was forced to agree. "It certainly was."<br>"There've been plenty of tragedies in my family," Stiles told him somberly. "We lost a half-dozen brave souls in the Romulan Wars alone. But choked to death with a cable..."<br>"Sir?" said Rayburn, who was seated closer to Kirk than Matthews was.<br>The captain turned to him, glad for the opportunity to speak to someone besides the morbid Stiles. "Yes, Lieutenant?"<br>"Is it true what they say about Lieutenant Mitchell and Dr. Dehner?" Rayburn asked. "That they died heroes as well?"<br>"I don't know what's being said," Kirk told him, adjusting his cast again, "and as you know, I'm not at liberty to discuss the details. However, my log reflects that Lieutenant Mitchell and Dr. Dehner died in the line of duty. That should tell you something."<br>Rayburn thought about it for a moment, then smiled. "Thank you, sir. I think I understand."<br>He didn't, of course. The security officer didn't have any inkling of the fate that had befallen Lieutenant Mitchell and Dr. Dehner. But then, that was the way the captain wanted it.<br>After all, neither Mitchell nor Dehner had asked to become something more than human. Neither of them had wanted to hurt their colleagues in any way. With that in mind, it wouldn't have been fair to label them monsters in the official record.<br>A moment later, Kirk's attention was drawn to the lectern, where Scotty was standing and making a point of clearing his throat. Kirk gave the engineer his attention. So did everyone else eventually, even the crewmen forced to stand in the back.<br>Scotty looked around. "Ye all know why we're gathered today, in such numbers it puts the size o' this wee, cramped chapel t' shame. We're here t' say goodbye and godspeed to our friend, Lee Kelso."<br> A murmur of agreement ran through the assemblage. After all, Kelso had been one of their favorites. He had enriched a lot of lives in his short time on the <i>Enterprise.</i><br>The engineer gestured and a man-sized duranium container, supported by an antigravity cart, appeared in the chapel's doorway. The man and woman attending the container, both of them ensigns in the science section, guided it into the room and positioned it next to Scotty.<br>Taking a moment to consider it, the engineer smiled a wistful smile. "If Kelso were here with us now, I believe he'd be wonderin' what all the fuss was about. After all, he'd say, he was just doin' his duty -- what any one of us would've done under the same circumstances. As ye know, he wasn't one t' toot his own horn."<br><i>True enough,</i> the captain thought. Kelso had been so self-effacing at times, Kirk had felt the urge to grab the helmsman and impose on him how important his contribution was.<br>At the lectern, the Scotsman shrugged. "I don't have to tell ye we were competitors, Kelso and I. Sure, he was a helmsman by trade, but the man prided himself on his engineerin' ability and his overall efficiency. And, as ye may have noticed, so do I."<br>The captain couldn't help but chuckle at the remark. He wasn't alone in that regard.<br>"The day I met him," Scotty continued, "Kelso had just come over from the <i>Potemkin.</i> I found the lad putterin' around on a catwalk in engineerin', his face screwed up tight in concentration, makin' wee adjustments to the deuterium injectors."<br>Kirk could picture Kelso doing something like that. There was another ripple of laughter from the audience.<br>"When I asked him what he was up to," said Scotty, "he told me he was tryin' t' get a bit more power out o' the engines. Apparently, some idiot of a chief engineer had everythin' set in the wrong ratios."<br>This time, the laughter was louder -- loud enough to echo from the bulkheads. Scotty grinned and shook his head.<br>"As ye know," he said, "Kelso and I were often on landing party teams together. What ye may nae know is that we used t' race like wee lads t' see who could make it to the transporter pad first."<br>Really, Kirk thought. Had he been aware of something like that, he would have put a stop to it. Unfortunately, Kelso wouldn't be doing any more racing, so the issue had become academic.<br>"Of course," Scotty noted, "I had a decided advantage, considerin' the bridge is farther from the transporter room than engineerin' is. And anyway, I never had t' wait for a replacement before I could take off. All I ever had t' do was give a few orders and be on my way."<br>That must have frustrated Kelso no end, Kirk mused. The man hated to come in second in anything -- even tic-tac-toe.<br>"Then," the engineer continued, "a few weeks ago, we ran into that Ceebriian derelict near Alpha Ortelina Seven, and the captain asked me and Kelso t' meet him in the transporter room." He shrugged. "Mind ye, havin' anticipated the summons, I was as ready as I'd ever been in my life. I left engineerin' at a brisk but confident pace, knowin' there was nae way Kelso could beat me to my destination.<br>"And yet," said Scotty, "when I reached the transporter room, there the lad was -- grinnin' as if he'd swallowed th' galaxy's largest canary. And he was nae even breathin' heavy, a sure sign I'd been hoodwinked."<br>The engineer shook his head. "It was nae until the next day that I forced the truth out o' the rascal. With the help of a transporter operator who'll remainnameless for her own good, he had reprogrammed the bloody controls -- fixin' it so a signal from the helm console would activate a special subroutine. A minute later, by which time Kelso would already have entered the turbolift, the transporter would activate itself and he'd be beamed directly to the transporter platform."<br>Stiles shot a look at the captain. "Interesting."<br>Kirk was more than a little discomfited by the tale. "You can say that again," he replied.<br>"And now," said Scotty, ...</p><h2>Pictures from Home</h2><p>Fine green cloth-covered boards with title blind-stamped on cover, and stamped in black on spine; with photographically illustrated dust jacket.

The Berlin Noir Trilogy quickly established Kerr and Gunther as the perfect combination of writer, character, setting and genre. These gritty, noir thrillers, narrated in Gunther&#39;s wry, sardonic voice, range all over Europe and beyond. They span a 20-year period from the mid-30s to the mid-50s, covering the build up to World War 2, the war itself and finally its bitter aftermath. With impeccable research that is accurate in every detail yet never interferes with narrative pace, Philip Kerr has created an epic series of thrillers that deserve all the praise that has been heaped upon them. Prague Fatale is Bernie Gunther&#39;s eighth outing. Set in Prague in 1942, it delivers all the fast-paced and quick-witted action that we have come to expect from Philip Kerr. It is an outstanding thriller by a writer at the top of his game.</p><p>Philip Kerr has written over thirty books of which the best-known are the internationally renowned and bestselling Bernie Gunther series. The sixth book in the series, If the Dead Rise Not, won the CWA Historical Dagger. His other works include several standalone thrillers, non-fiction and an acclaimed series for younger readers, The Children of the Lamp.

A dependable and honest guide for parents and instructors interested in teaching kids about the diversity of Native America.</p><p>The Native American (NA) experience as presented in children's books is reviewed through essays, poetry, book reviews, guidelines for evaluating books, a resource list of organizations, a bibliography of books by and about NAs, American Indian authors for young readers, and illustrations. The essays may help or hinder Native American concerns. There is hostility: "You know us (NAs) only as enemies." No location is given for the cited Iroquois document which states: "Even the form of our government seems to owe a greater debt to the Constitution of the Six Nations of the Iroquois than to any European document." One positive suggestion is offered: "Visit with living American Indian people, try to find out more about their ways of life and their languages." The book reviews are similar to the essays, and the illustrations are traditional. The poetry, guidelines, resource list, bibliography, and list of authors are sensitive and informative, which makes this a recommended selection for academic libraries.<br><i>- Lois F.

A land of petty kingdoms and ambitious men...</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When King Gorm betrays Jarl Harald and puts his family to the sword, he makes a terrible mistake. He fails to kill Harald&#x2019;'s youngest son, Sigurd. Hunted by powerful men and hiding in a sacred fen, Sigurd believes the gods have turned their backs on his family. His kin are dead or captured. His village is attacked and its people taken as slaves. Honour is lost. Yet all men know that �din, whose name means frenzy, is drawn to chaos and bloodshed as a raven is to the slaughtered dead -- and Sigurd means to spill blood.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone but for a small band of loyal men including his red-bearded friend Svein, his father&#x2019;s right-hand man Olaf, and Asgot the godi, Sigurd hungers to avenge the murder of his family. In an attempt to catch �din&#x2019;'s eye, the young man sacrifices himself -- as the god once did -- and it is during this ritual ordeal that Sigurd is shown a vision. The Wolf. The Bear. The Serpent. The Eagle. Sigurd will need all these and more if he is to become a man whom others will follow... and if he is to make kings pay in blood for their treachery.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gods have spoken and Sigurd&#x2019;s quest begins. Using cunning and war-craft he must gather the fiercest warriors of the north -- warriors such as Bram who men call Bear, Black Floki who is death with a blade, and the shield Maiden Valgerd, who brave men fear -- and convince them to follow him. For whether or not �din is with him, Sigurd will have his vengeance and neither men nor the gods can stand in his way. Be assured that when the blood is flowing, the gods are watching.</p><p>Family history (he is half Norwegian) and his storytelling hero, Bernard Cornwell, inspired GILES KRISTIAN to write his first historical novels, the acclaimed and bestselling Raven Viking trilogy -- <i>Blood Eye, Sons of Thunder </i>and <i>Odin's Wolves</i>.

Humanity has raised exploiting the solar system to an art form. Bella Lind and the crew of her nuclear-powered ship, the Rockhopper, push ice. They mine comets. And they're good at it. The Rockhopper is nearing the end of its current mission cycle, and everyone is desperate for some much-needed R &amp; R, when startling news arrives from Saturn: Janus, one of Saturn's ice moons, has inexplicably left its natural orbit and is now heading out of the solar system at high speed. As layers of camouflage fall away, it becomes clear that Janus was never a moon in the first place. It's some kind of machine-and it is now headed toward a fuzzily glimpsed artifact 260 light-years away. The Rockhopper is the only ship anywhere near Janus, and Bella Lind is ordered to shadow it for the few vital days before it falls forever out of reach. In accepting this mission, she sets her ship and her crew on a collision course with destiny-for Janus has more surprises in store, and not all of them are welcome.</p><p>Born in Barry, South Wales, Alastair Reynolds studied at Newcastle University and the University of St. Andrews.

There had always been people eager to tell her that her proposal was doomed, but for the first time it occurred to her that they could be right.

Once every five hundred years, when the representatives were summoned to New Far Florence, Chromis and Rudd would meet to swap world-weary tales of scandal and chicanery from their respective constituencies.</p><p>Chromis fingered the ring on her right index finger, tracing the interlocking, hypnotically complex design embossed into its surface. &#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;ll go for it? It&#x2019;s been eighteen thousand years, after all. It&#x2019;s asking a lot of people to think back that far.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The whole point of this little exercise is to dream up something to commemorate ten thousand years of our glorious Congress,&#x201d; Rudd said, with only the slightest trace of irony. &#x201c;If the other representatives can&#x2019;t get off their fat backsides and think back another eight thousand years before that, they deserve to have the reeves set on them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t joke,&#x201d; Chromis said darkly. &#x201c;I heard they had to send in the reeves on Hemlock only four hundred years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Messy business, too: by all accounts there were at least a dozen non-recoverable dead. But I wasn&#x2019;t joking, Chromis: if they don&#x2019;t bite, I&#x2019;ll personally recommend a police action.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If only everyone else felt the same way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then damn well go in there and see to it that they do.&#x201d; Rudd offered his hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time, anyway. The last thing you want to do is keep any of them waiting.&#x201d;</p><p>She took his hand chastely. Rudd was an attractive man, and Chromis had it on good authority that she had many admirers in the Congress, but their friendship was strictly platonic: they both had partners back on their home-worlds, held in stasis cauls until they returned from New Far Florence. Chromis loved her husband, although many days might pass between thoughts of him. Without his help convincing one hundred and thirty worlds that this was something they had to support, the memorial plan would have stalled long ago.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m really worried, Rudd. Worried I&#x2019;m about to screw up nearly a thousand years of preparation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep your nerve and stick to the script,&#x201d; Rudd said sternly. &#x201c;No last-minute clever ideas, all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Same goes for you. Remember: &#x2018;intended recipient&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>Rudd smiled reassuringly and led her into the stratospheric vastness of the meeting room. The chamber had been constructed in the early centuries of the Congress, when it had aspirations to expand into territory now occupied by neighbouring polities. Space not being at a premium on New Far Florence, the hundred-odd representatives were scattered across nearly a square kilometre of gently sloping floor space, and the ceiling was ten kilometres above their heads. Slowly rotating in the middle of the room, lacking any material suspension, was the display cube in which their enlarged images would appear when they had the floor. While it waited for the session to begin, the cube projected the ancient emblem of the Congress: a three-dimensional rendering of Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s drawing of a naked man encompassed within a square and circle, his limbs drawn twice so that he stood upon, and touched, both shapes.</p><p>Chromis and Rudd took their positions on either side of the floor. The last few delegates were arriving by transit caul: black humanoid shells popped into existence in the chamber before dissipating to reveal the occupants within. The femtomachinery of the cauls merged seamlessly with the local machinery of the Congress building. Every artificial object in the Congress of the Lindblad Ring&#x2014;from the largest frameshift liner to the smallest medical robot&#x2014;comprised countless copies of the same universal femtomachine element.</p><p>Routine business consumed the first hour of the meeting. Chromis sat patiently, shuffling mental permutations, wondering whether she should consider a change of approach. It was difficult to judge the mood of the gathering. But Rudd&#x2019;s advice had been sound. She held her nerve, and when she had the floor she spoke the words she had already committed to memory before leaving home.</p><p>&#x201c;Honoured delegates,&#x201d; she began, as her magnified image appeared in the display cube, &#x201c;we are nearing the ten thousandth year since the founding of our first colony&#x2014;the beginning of what we now recognise as the Congress of the Lindblad Ring. I believe we are all of a mind in one respect: something must be done to acknowledge this coming milestone, something that will reflect well upon our administration, especially in light of the similar anniversaries that have recently been celebrated in two of our neighbouring polities. There have been many suggestions as to how we might mark this occasion. A civic project, perhaps, such as a well-deserved terraforming or a timely stellar rejuvenation. A Dyson englobement&#x2014;purely for the hell of it&#x2014;or the frame-shifting of an entire world from one system to another. Even something as modest as the erection of a ceremonial dome or an ornamental fountain.&#x201d; Chromis paused and looked pointedly at the delegates who had proposed these latter projects, hoping that they felt suitably abashed at their dismal lack of vision.</p><p>&#x201c;There have been many excellent proposals, and doubtless there will be many more, but I wish to suggest something of an entirely different magnitude. Rather than creating something for ourselves, a monument in our own galactic backyard, I humbly suggest that we consider something altogether more altruistic. I propose an audacious act of cosmic gratitude: the sending of a message, a gift, across space and time. The intended recipient of this gift will be the person&#x2014;or the descendants of the person&#x2014;without whom the very fabric of our society would look unrecognisably different.&#x201d;</p><p>Chromis paused again, still unable to judge the mood of the delegates, the blank faces of those close enough to see conveying neither approval nor disapproval. She took a deep breath and pressed on. &#x201c;Doubtless we would have achieved some of the same advances eventually&#x2014;but who is to say that it wouldn&#x2019;t have taken tens of thousands of years rather than the mere handful of millennia it actually took? Instead of a mosaic of polities spread across nearly twelve thousand light-years of the galactic disc, we might very well be confined to a handful of systems, with all the risks that such close confinement would inevitably entail. And let us not forget that the insights that have allowed us to leapfrog centuries of slow development were given to us freely, with no expectation of reward. Our Benefactor sent that data back to Earth because it was the right thing to do.&#x201d; Here Chromis swallowed, uncomfortably aware that some might be thinking&#x2014;not without cause&#x2014;that the very same data had almost wiped out humanity as it struggled to assimilate dangerous new knowledge. But at a remove of eighteen thousand years, such thoughts were surely churlish. Fire had singed more than a few fingers before people learned how to use it.</p><p>She heard a few unconvinced grumbles, but no one chose to interrupt her. Chromis steeled herself and continued, &#x201c;I know that some of us have forgotten the precise nature of that act of charity. In a moment, I hope to jog our collective memory. But first let me outline exactly what I have in mind.&#x201d;</p><p>She craned her neck to look at the display cube. On cue, her image was replaced by a simulation of the galaxy, as if viewed from far outside: ancient and huge, littered with the humbling relics of the Spicans but empty of life&#x2014;so far as anyone knew&#x2014;save for the smudge of human presence spreading out from one spiral arm, like an inkblot.</p><p>&#x201c;The Benefactor and her people are still out there somewhere,&#x201d; Chromis said, &#x201c;almost certainly beyond the Hard Data Frontier&#x2014;perhaps even outside the galaxy itself. But unless the universe has more tricks up its sleeve than we suspect, they can&#x2019;t be more than eighteen thousand light-years away, even if they&#x2019;re still moving away from us. And perhaps they&#x2019;ve already arrived wherever...</p></p><h2>Venom: Dark Origin</h2><p>On the unlikely day when an embittered, washed-up journalist met a spurned symbiotic organism from an alien planet, a force of evil and vengeance like no other in the Marvel Universe was born: Venom!

John McPhee chronicles the perhaps unfathomable perseverance of the aircraft's sucessive progenitors</p></p><p>Since the explosion of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, energy-efficient, lighter-than-air ships have given way to gas-guzzling jet aircraft. But in the 1960s, an unusual band of inventors, engineers and investors, again in New Jersey, created the Aereon, a strange, wingless hybrid airplane/dirigible. The Aereon--the Deltoid Pumpkin Seed-- promised to be a safe workhorse of the skies, capable of carrying the payload of entire freight trains with minimal cost. <p> In this exquisitely crafted tale of back-to-the-drawing-board perseverance, McPhee tells the story not only of the Aereon, but of any product development team. He astutely delineates the team members' personalities and interactions, delves back in time to the origins of lighter-than-air craft and the history of propellers, and in the end, makes us wonder why this promising technology hasn't been perfected. Like <i>Aramis: Or the Love of Technology</i>, this is a splendid book about a potentially superior aircraft which has yet to be adopted.</p><p><b>John McPhee</b> was born in Princeton, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Cambridge University.

Considered in context, the film&#x2019;s unreasonable optimism, rooted in its characters&#x2019; sincere desire to keep playing, is a powerful response to the political, economic, and social stresses of the late 1970s.<br><br>To Wilker&#x2019;s surprise, despite repeated viewings, <i>The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training</i> continues to move him.

Merrill.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Madelon Bedell, author of <i>The Alcotts: Biography of a Family</i><br><br>Louisa May Alcott was a writer who liked to be in intimate touch with the reader. There is a confidential immediacy to her style, often punctuated with sly stabs of satire and irony. One of the principal charms of her writing is her great warmth for her characters, and theirs for one another. Nowhere is this better displayed than in the classics <i>Little Women</i> and <i>Little Men</i>, which are here in their entirety. <br>The short stories in THE BEST OF LOUISA MAY ALCOTT come from the period of Alcott&#x2019;s most powerful and mature writing, which began in the 1860s, when she dealt forcibly with real issues and real people. These stories touch on strong human qualities&#x2013;joy, compassion, humor, courage, dignity, heart-tugging poignancy, guilt, or fancifulness&#x2013;and portray the moments when those qualities come into focus.<br>Alcott&#x2019;s work has a wonderful range. There are delicious romance, like the frankly autobiographical &#x201c;My Boys,&#x201d; a rollicking account of some of the author&#x2019;s experiences, full of her salty, sardonic humor and generosity of spirit. There is also &#x201c;Cupid and Chow-Chow,&#x201d; still very relevant today, dealing with courage and guilt, and sexism in the nursery.<br>There is comedy and suspense in &#x201c;Clams,&#x201d; a marvelous ghost story.

It is an event that will revolutionize the study of the ancient Middle East and will have an impact on our understanding of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. What has been revealed is a startling previously unknown kingdom, dating from 2400 B.C., over one thousands years before King Solomon; the oldest known Semite script; and a vastly influential and totally unexpected center of early culture that now takes its place alongside those of Mesopotamia and Egypt. EBLA: An Empire Rediscovered is the account of a brilliant young archeologist named Paolo Matthiae whose eleven-year excavations on Tell Mardikh, a mound forty miles from Aleppo, revealed the remains of a once great city burned down in 2000 B.C.. They found splendid architecture, finely crated furniture and ornaments, seals and other evidence of a royal capital, and in 1974 a unique cache of forty cuneiform tablets. In 1975 an entire state archive was found with over 15,000 tablets and fragments in an unknown, very archaic Semite language since called Eblaite. Ebla, as the city was known to be, and as these tablets showed, was a busy commercial empire, a producer and exporter of woolen cloth and fine furniture , a high kingdom with many tributary kings, in contact with places as distant as Kish in Mesopotamia, Kanesch in Antolia, and Jerusalem. Filled with photographs, maps and tables, Ebla: An Empire Rediscovered is a lavishly illustrated and scholarly account of one of the greatest archaeological finds of the twentieth century.</p><p>Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>Of Bonobos and Men: A Journey to the Heart of the Congo</h2><p>Bonobos have captured the public imagination in recent years, due not least to their famously active sex lives. Less well known is the fact that these great apes don&#x2019;t kill their own kind, and that they share nearly 99% of our DNA. Their approach to building peaceful coalitions and sharing resources has much to teach us, particularly at a time when our violent ways have pushed them to the brink of extinction. Animated by a desire to understand bonobos and learn how to save them, acclaimed author Deni Ellis B�chard traveled into the Congo.<br><br><i>Of Bonobos and Men</i> is the account of this journey. Along the way, we see how partnerships between Congolese and Westerners, with few resources but a common purpose and respect for indigenous knowledge, have resulted in the protection of vast swaths of the rainforest. And we discover how small solutions found through openness, humility, and the principle that poverty does not equal ignorance&#x201d; are often most effective in tackling our biggest challenges. Combining elements of travelogue, journalism, and natural history, this incomparably rich book takes the reader not only deep into the Congo, but also into our past and future, revealing new ways to save the environment and ourselves.</p><p>NATURE | APES &amp; MONKEYS $26.95<br><br>When acclaimed author Deni B�chard learned of the last living bonobos matriarchal great apes that are, alongside chimpanzees, our closest relatives in the animal kingdom he was astonished. How could we accept the disappearance of this majestic species, along with the rainforest it calls home?<br><br>As he looked more closely, B�chard discovered that one relatively small organization, the Bonobo Conservation Initiative (BCI), has done more to save bonobos than a number of far larger organizations. In contrast to many traditional conservation groups, BCI does not impose a system on Congolese communities. It approaches conservation as a process of exchange, in which the rainforest&#x2019;s people teach conservationists to understand the local culture and ecosystem. BCI then partners with village leaders, helping them strengthen their communities and address the unemployment and lack of education that lead to the hunting of bonobos. The result is a truly postcolonial model of conservation. And because the local people feel that it emerges from their culture, they replicate its projects independently.<br><br>The struggle to prevent the extinction of bonobos is far from easy, to be sure. The Congo has been devastated by war and aggressive resource extraction, and its people are often skeptical of foreign intervention. But B�chard&#x2019;s moving account based on travels in the Congo and hundreds of interviews reminds us that poverty does not equate to ignorance, that change requires more than wealth and power, and that only through collaboration can we make conservation go viral.<br><br><b>Deni B�chard</b> is the author of a memoir, <i>Cures for Hunger</i>, and a novel, <i>Vandal Love</i>, which won the 2007 Commonwealth Writers&#x2019; Prize.

Black has brought to the task a perspective on Mississippi art that was informed by a lifetime's dedication to art, years of curating museum exhibitions of Mississippi artists, and, specifically for this volume, three years of intensive research in museums and private collections around the country.</p><p>In Art in Mississippi she focuses on several hundred significant artists and showcases in full color the work of more than two hundred.</p><p>Nationally acclaimed native Mississippians are here-George Ohr, Walter Anderson, Marie Hull, Theora Hamblett, William Dunlap, Sam Gilliam, William Hollings-worth, Jr., Karl Wolfe, Mildred Nungester Wolfe, John McCrady, Ed McGowin, James Seawright, and many others. Prominent artists who lived or worked in the state for a significant period of time are included as well-John James Audubon, Louis Comfort Tiffany, George Caleb Bingham, William Aiken Walker, and more. There are many surprises here, for Black has gathered so much remarkable art that readers will be staggered by the richness of the visual art tradition in Mississippi.</p><p>Black explores how art reflects the land and how modes of living and values dictated by Mississippi's changing topography created a variety of art forms. She demonstrates the influence of Mississippi's diverse cultures upon the art and shows how it has responded in many forms-painting, architecture, sculpture, fine crafts-to the changing aesthetics of national art movements. She observes that much art was created to fill immediate needs of the times-reverent depictions of the Civil War, highly wrought expressions of the intensely devout, and works of social realism that grappled with a changing society.</p><p>Those who have long been fascinated by the magnificent literature and music produced by this southern state will encounter yet another treasure trove in <i>Art in Mississippi, 1720-1980</i>. Students of Mississippi's phenomenal cultural history will be captivated by this splendid volume.</p></p><p><p>An elegant and panoramic overview of Mississippi?s art heritage</p>Patti Carr Black has written and edited many books, including Agnes Grinstead Anderson's <i>Approaching the Magic Hour: Memories of Walter Anderson</i>; <i>Made by Hand: Mississippi Folk Art</i>; and <i>Sea, Earth, Sky: The Art of Walter Anderson</i>.</p><h2>Usagi Yojimbo Volume 33: The Hidden (Usagi Yojimbo, 33)</h2><p><b>Usagi and his friend Inspector Ishida join forces once again as they embark on a mission to track down and uncover the importance of a foreign book that's been at the root of many problems across the land.</b><br><br>The daring duo, desperate to solve the mystery and restore peace, are forced to undertake unusual measures as well as enlist the help of a few surprising sources to get the information they require.

Jim Unger&#x2019;s thoughts on Herman: "I think what happened with this Herman thing is it's so stupid that it makes you laugh. Herman is nobody, nothing. He's just a prop for my way of expressing life. I'm telling people, 'Hey, you idiot, this is what you look like.'"

They recently had a conversation about their careers as picture book authors. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> When I was only four years old, I announced to my family in particular and to the world in general that I was going to become an artist, and write stories and draw pictures for books. I never swayed from that early declaration. I&#x2019;ve always been curious to know, what inspired you to become a creator and illustrator of picture books? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My career began as a graphic designer and for a number of years I worked as an art director for an advertising agency in New York. In the mid 1960's Bill Martin, Jr. saw an ad of a red lobster that I had designed and asked me to illustrate his <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> Well, I was set on fire! I was so inspired by this book, and the opportunity to illustrate it changed my life. After that, I started to create my own books, both words and pictures, and really it was then that I had found my true course in life. <br> <br> Now, I have a question for you, Tomie. How would you describe your artistic style, and has it changed over time? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> My illustration style is heavily influenced by folk art--strong simple shapes, bold lines, color, color, color and a deceptive simplicity. My style began to develop early in art school, and through the years, it hasn&#x2019;t changed very much, but it has refined itself. How would you describe yours? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My aim with my work is to simplify and refine, be logical and harmonious. I like to use simple shapes, bright colors and a lot of white space. I write for the child inside of me. That is always where I begin. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> I do, as well. The only audience I keep in mind is that four-year-old in me. People sometimes ask me what advice I would give to young artists. I always think of the wonderful advice I received from my twin cousins when they were in art school in the late '30s. They told me, &#x201c;Practice, practice, practice and don&#x2019;t copy.&#x201d; <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> I often tell people about the four magic letters: DO IT. I want to be encouraging but I can only offer the example of my own experience, which is just one approach. There are many wonderful artists to learn about, which is important. But you must use your own imagination. You have to just do it. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> How do you feel knowing that a copy of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> is sold every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> It is hard for me, maybe for others too, to grasp this concept. But I am truly honored that my story is enjoyed by so many and that it is now being shared by a generation of parents who grew up with my book. How about your <i>Strega Nona</i>. She is one of your most popular characters. Can you share how she came to be? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> In the &#x2018;70s when I was teaching at a college, we were required to attend faculty meetings. I always sat in the back with a yellow legal pad. Everyone thought I was taking notes. At one meeting a doodle appeared of a little lady with a big nose and a big chin. I named her Strega Nona, and the rest is history. Speaking of history, how will you be celebrating the third annual <i>Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day this year? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> On <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day, March 20th, I will probably be at home with my wife, Bobbie (I am a bit of a hermit, actually). But I will be saying a little toast to the caterpillar for whom I have a special place in my heart. And speaking of holidays, isn&#x2019;t your favorite holiday Christmas. Do you have a special Christmas memory? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> Christmas is my favorite holiday. My favorite Christmas was the one when I received tons and tons of art supplies: everything from an easel to paints, pads and pads of paper, and &#x201c;how to draw&#x201d; books. <br>Tomie dePaola is one of the most popular children&#x2019;s book authors and illustrators of our time and the recipient of the 2011 Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, among other lifetime achievement awards.

Hillenbrand&#x2019;s immense attention to detail is gratifying" &#x2014; KIRKUS REVIEWS (starred review)</b><br><br>When a very curious little girl meets a cow named Luella who is even <br>more stubborn than she is, who will be the first to back down? Phyllis <br>Root&#x2019;s spirited tall tale finds a family of countless hungry children - <br>and a magic cow who demands a kiss on the nose to keep the sweet <br>milk flowing.</p><p>Never. Not a chance. Annalisa wouldn't dream of kissing Luella the cow, even though her mother kisses her every day after singing her a song and milking her. Still, inquisitive Annalisa is awfully interested in milking Luella, and one day she sneaks off and does everything just the way her mother does--all except for the kiss on the nose. The next day, Luella refuses to give any milk. And the day after that is the same. Annalisa's mother and her many brothers and sisters beg the stubborn little girl to relent, but Annalisa says "Never!... Never, never, never." Will the whole family have to live without milk and cheese forever? Or will Annalisa's innate curiosity get the best of her? <p> Both Phyllis Root and Will Hillenbrand claim to have tried to kiss cows while working on this story, but to no avail. "I was willing," Hillenbrand says, "but the cow wasn't." With red-haired Annalisa's little nose in the air throughout the story, readers will almost hear her cries of "never," and will surely identify with one whose feelings of absolute certainty can occasionally change. (Ages 4 to 7) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Phyllis Root says, "I did not know what it was actually like to kiss a cow. So I went to the State Fair with every intention of kissing a cow. But when I got to the cow barn, there were all these 4-H kids who had raised their cows and were so proud of them. Somehow it didn't feel respectful to ask if I could kiss their cows."<br><br>Will Hillenbrand says he drew on memories of summers spent on a farm with his aunt and uncle and their thirteen children. "My cousins were full of practical jokes for me&#x2014;the city kid&#x2014;like squirting my face while milking the cow. My aunt was incredible. She never stopped working and could never imagine not working. It was such a warm, lively place, and I hope that comes through in the pictures." He also admits to trying to kiss a cow on a farm in Wisconsin. "I was willing," he recalls, "but the cow wasn't."</p><h2>A Regular Guy</h2><p>Anywhere But Here and The Lost Father have established Mona Simpson as one of our most accomplished writers. In her new novel--the portrait of a legendary, quintessentially American entrepreneur trapped by the age he helped to define--she brilliantly extends her achievement. More powerfully than ever before, Simpson uncovers the nature of longing and belonging, of blood relations and the human heart.</p><p>Mona Simpson's first two novels, <i>Anywhere but Here</i> and <i>The Lost Father</i>, won her literary renown and a wide following. Now, in her third novel, the narrator Ann Atassi has been replaced by a third-person narrator recounting the adventures of young Jane di Natali, but the theme remains the same: the search for, and the attempt to understand, the absent father. This time the father is a millionaire biotechnology magnate named Tom Owens--loosely based, perhaps, on Steven Jobs, Mona Simpson's half-brother and the founder of Apple Computers. Fans of Simpson's previous novels will not be disappointed by this excursion into the cracked world of family relations.Mona Simpson since 1988 has taught at Bard College, where she is now the Sadie Samuelson Levy Professor of Languages and Literature.</p><h2>The Boys Body Book</h2><p>Kelli Dunham, RN, BSN, is a nurse, stand-up comic, and author of How to Survive and Maybe Even Love Nursing School, How to Survive and Maybe Even Love Your Life as a Nurse, and The Boy&#39;s Body Book: Everything You Need to Know for Growing Up You, also published by Applesauce Press.

This thrilling tale of Joyaity, betrayal and international espionage spans the lives of two friends from the not-torn West Berlin of the 1960s to the grimy looking-glass of Cold War Europe to the present day of terrorism and uncertain new alliances-alliances that aren&#39;t always what they seem to be.</p><p><b> John le Carr�&nbsp;</b>was born in 1931. His third&nbsp;novel, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, secured&nbsp;him a worldwide reputation, which was consolidated&nbsp;by the acclaim for his trilogy Tinker, Tailor, Soldier,&nbsp;Spy; The Honourable Schoolboy; and Smiley&#x2019;s People.&nbsp;His recent novels include The Constant Gardener,&nbsp;Absolute Friends, The Mission Song, A Most Wanted&nbsp;Man, and Our Kind of Traitor. A Delicate Truth is his&nbsp;twenty-third novel.English Teddy Mundy and German Sasha are the absolute friends of the title. Their intersecting lives and involvement in espionage create an uncommon structure for John le Carr�'s timely and provocative new novel. The first two-thirds of the flashback-laden plot focuses mostly on Mundy, his seedy life as cashiered double agent/current tour guide in a Bavarian castle and his past adventures with Sasha. The last third of the book concerns a scheme that the revolutionary Sasha ("I have the Lutheran curse. Conviction without action has no meaning.") presents to Mundy to undermine the American/British incursion in Iraq with the backing of a mysterious philanthropist. John Lee handles the many characters and accents well; he is at his best in pacing the book so that the listener enjoys complete clarity about the timeframe of the shifting events. Lee also excels in the dramatic final scenes.

Before he got the chance to find out, however, an automobile accident in Ireland left him with the lasting wounds of body and spirit that ultimately led him to take his own life. But as his dear friend novelist Francine Prose notes in this volume&#x2019;s foreword, &#x201c;Even when his depression became so severe that he was barely able to hold a simple conversation, he was, miraculously, able to perform.&#x201d; <br><br>As was always his method, Gray began to fashion a new monologue in various workshop settings that would tell the story of the accident and its aftermath. Originally titled <i>Black Spot</i>&#x2014;for what the locals called the section of highway where Gray&#x2019;s accident occurred&#x2014;it began as a series of workshops at P.S. 122 in New York City and eventually became <i>Life Interrupted</i>.Gray died in early 2004, and though never completed, <i>Life Interrupted</i> is rich with brave self-revelation, masterfully acute observations of wonderfully peculiar people, penetrating wit and genuine humor, an irresolvable fascination with life and death, and all the other attributes of Gray&#x2019;s singular and unmistakable voice.<br><br>In the final performance of <i>Life Interrupted</i>, Gray read two additional pieces: a short story about a day he spent with his son Theo at the carousel in Central Park and a brief, poignant love letter to New York City that he wrote after the terrorist attacks in 2001. This volume includes these pieces as well as many of the eulogies that were delivered by his friends and family at memorial services held at Lincoln Center and in Sag Harbor.<br>[If you had to reduce all of Spalding&#x2019;s work to its essence, its core, if you wanted to locate the subject to which, no matter what else he talked about, he kept returning, I suppose you could say that his work was a profoundly metaphysical inquiry into how we manage to live despite the knowledge that we are someday going to die. . . .<br><br>If there is a consolation, it&#x2019;s what he left behind: the children whom he so loved and, of course, his work. Reading the unfinished pieces in this volume . . . we hear his voice again and feel the happiness we felt when he sat on stage behind his wooden desk, took a sip from his water glass, transformed the raw material of his life into art, and the crowd applauded each brilliant, beautiful sentence.] &#x2014;<b>Francine Prose, from the Foreword</b><br>Also available as an eBook</p><p>Writer, actor, and performer Spalding Gray was the author of <i>It&#x2019;s a Slippery Slope</i>; <i>Swimming to Cambodia</i>; <i>Monster in a Box</i>; <i>Morning, Noon and Night</i>; and <i>Impossible Vacation</i>, among other works. He appeared on Broadway in his own one-man shows and in an acclaimed revival of <i>Our Town</i> and Gore Vidal&#x2019;s <i>The Best Man</i>, on PBS and HBO, and in numerous films, including Roland Joff�&#x2019;s <i>The Killing Fields</i>, David Byrne&#x2019;s <i>True Stories</i>, and more recently Steven Soderbergh&#x2019;s <i>Gray&#x2019;s Anatomy</i>. He was still working on <i>Life Interrupted</i> at the time of his death in 2004.Life Interrupted<br><br>I didn't think there'd be another monologue, and I'm still not sure if there is. I had settled down into domesticity and a quiet life out in Sag Harbor and didn't want to continue making family soap opera. Or at least I thought I didn't. <br><br>When I turned sixty there was no big celebration, just a family gathering. I said I didn't want anything. NPR did announce it on <i>Morning Edition</i>, I was happy to hear. Garrison Keillor did not, on his birthday show. We're not exactly on the best of terms. I reviewed a book of his called <i>Leaving Home</i> in the <i>New York Times</i>, and I opened with my girlfriend at the time saying that if I played that show <i>Prairie Home Companion</i> again she'd throw the radio out the window. <br><br>There was no party, just a birthday dinner at home, and I remember Forrest, my eight-year-old, saying, "Hey, Dad, remember how much fun it was having a birthday before you found out that you were going to die?" <br><br>Then there was a surprise. About two weeks after that, Kathie, my wife, gave me a present of a trip to Ireland for the whole family. Kathie's always coming up with these crazy trips. I remember she took us to the Ice Hotel up in Quebec City where you pay three hundred dollars a night to sleep on a block of ice. So Ireland was cushy. It was a rainy version of the Ice Hotel, I suppose. A little more whimsical, and rainy, and not frozen. I'd been six times before and wanted to go back. It made me laugh in a way that the United States doesn't. We had rainy times but good times. In spite of the rain it was a jolly place. I can remember Kathie and me riding bikes in the rain for hours and then coming upon this Irishman leaning against his bicycle with a golf hat on or whatever they wear, and he said, "How are you doing?" I said, "It's just awful weather, it's just awful," and he said, "No, it's not. It hasn't gotten cold yet." <br><br>So I like them; they're optimistic and philosophical. They're not industrialized, really-there was no industrial revolution-so they drive pretty haphazardly. They don't have a great relationship to machinery, to say the least. There's a lot of banging around and the roads are very narrow, and they just get in their cars and go, you know they just put the pedal to the metal and they're going everywhere, in all directions. <br><br>We were invited to the Scanlon estate. John Scanlon was a publicist, a very big one, in all senses of the word. He was a publicist for Bill Clinton, actually, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and he had this huge house in Ireland that he was inviting a group of us over to for this birthday bash. He was a big gourmand, and he perished in front of the TV after a big meal just two weeks before we were supposed to go, just died. His wife said, "Come on over anyway, John would have loved it." <br><br>So over we went, in spite of his death, about twelve of us, five children-my niece, my stepdaughter, and my two sons, and Tara Newman's son-and the rest adults, and the house was big enough to accommodate that without any confusion. I have to say that this place, exquisite stone manor that it was, reminded me a little bit of <i>The Shining</i>. It was disconcerting, actually. It was set right in the middle of these woods and fields, and the kids went running in the �elds with no fear of deer ticks for the �rst time in a long time. The woods looked like Harry Potter woods; they were very old, it was about twelve acres of land, and all very spooky. It was in the town of Mort, which was even more of a spooky name, in the county of Offaly. O-f-f-a-l-y. <br><br>We arrived on the longest day of the year, June 21, 2001, and all went to celebrate with a treasure hunt. In the morning, the following day, the next-longest day of the year, Barbara Leary was down in the kitchen-Barbara Leary was the ex-wife of Timothy Leary and she was one of the guests there-and I was talking with her and she said that she'd dreamt that I'd done a new monologue, and I said, "No, there's nothing on the table, really, nothing new. My life is without crisis and usually they're based on crisis, and I don't have anything planned at all. Things are going smoothly." <br><br>(Knocks three times on the desktop) <br><br>So off we went to this monastery, and I guess it was kind of the �rst harbinger of death, although death seemed everywhere in Ireland. This was a monastery on a river where the Vikings used to come and raid it and burn the books and kill the priests. There was a funeral going on, or at least the grave diggers were digging some graves right near the monastery and taking a cigarette break. I remember that, it was kind of Hamletesque. <br><br>Then, driving home, another funereal thing happened. They had the funeral announcements on the radio. I'd never heard anything like that in my life. There must have been about sixteen deaths. Every one of them had put up a courageous struggle, had led an exemplary life, never had a bad word to say about anybody. The announcer read in a monotone, with no inflection at all, pausing about five seconds between each name and then talked about the removal time, Saturday at four-thirty, or whenever the body was going to be removed. <br><br>So there was a lot of death in the air that day. When we got home, I took a walk to kind of relieve myself of all that, and walked about six miles through dairy country. The cows were baying and mooing. Mad cow disease was around. I had a feeling they were trying to warn me about something. It was the last long walk I'd ever take in my life. I had no idea at the time, did not imagine it. At the end of the walk I came upon a calf that was in real distress. It couldn't stand up, it had arthritis, and it was looking me right in the eye and pleading with me to put it out of its pain. I told the farmer, "That calf is suffering. You should call a vet, or have something done with it." He said, "Ah, yes, I'll be doing that then. Thank you for looking after it." <br><br>So off I went thinking I'd saved the calf, or put him out of his misery, and off we went, �ve adults-Barbara Leary and her boyfriend, Kim; Tara Newman; and Kathie and I-to have dinner at John Scanlon's favorite restaurant. I have to say, it wasn't that good. Maybe in terms of Irish cuisine it was, but my duck was dry. <br><br>What did we talk about-we talked about the art critic Robert Hughes's car accident that he'd had in Australia, and how dif�cult that would be, to have a car accident in a foreign country like that. Then there was this discussion about who would drive home. We'd all been drinking, not a lot, but Kathie had only had one glass of wine so she was the designated driver. So we're off and she says, "Buckle up," and no one in the back seat pays any attention to her. Tara Newman says, "Yes, Mom," very condescendingly, and I-God, I didn't hear her; Kathie says it's because I don't listen. I just didn't buckle up. I think I was taking a pee in the bushes, a last-minute pee, and I got in and so we're off on a backcountry road. I didn't think anything could possibly happen on a backcountry road. We'd come on a main highway and the speeding was terri�c, but on the country road I thought it would be . . . <br><br>Just about one mile from the mansion-and they say these things happen within a mile of your destination, that's why my friend Donald says that he drives like crazy to get out of that radius-I look up and I see in Kathie's window what looks like a cartoon of a van. It looks like a video game. I can't take it in. We had stopped to turn right, we were still, and the road was a narrow country road, there were no lanes, just a road, and coming at me, at us, was this yellow van. It must have been coming very fast, because all I got was one glimpse of it, its headlights. It was dusk, it was ten-fifteen, and there was this enormous crash that I remember as the most violent moment of my life. It was equal to an earthquake that I'd gone through in California, which had sounded like a bomb. <br><br>Our car spun around three times, that's how hard he hit, and he drove the engine right into the front seat of the car, where Kathie burned her arm. Somehow she got out. I thought Kim, who was next to her, was dead. His forehead was down on the dashboard. Tara Newman was yelling, "The car's going to explode. Everyone get out!" I don't remember getting out, but the next I knew I was lying in the road next to Kathie, and she's saying, "I'm dying! I'm dying!" and I'm saying, solipsist that I am, "But I can't straighten out my leg!" And I couldn't. There was a woman kneeling beside me, sopping blood off my face, talking to me, saying that this is a very dangerous black spot, a black spot on the highway where there had been other accidents. She'd lost her nine-year-old son the year before just about a hundred feet from where I was lying. There was cow medicine everywhere, because the van that hit us was the veterinarian, the local vet, who, I think, probably was up taking care of that poor sick calf that I'd reported. It was bedlam. Tara Newman was directing traf�c around us because none of the cars would wait. The police arrived and wouldn't even give a Breathalyzer test to the guy driving the van. They said they didn't like to get involved on that level. <br><br>The ambulance came and it took an hour. It was like a World War II bread truck, all rattling, and they loaded me in with the guy that hit me, we shared the ambulance together, and I was in such pain and shock that I did not get angry with him. To this day I regret it. I am so unconfrontational. Instead of moaning and weeping about my hip I should have been saying, "You fucking asshole! You ruined our vacation." But I'm so involved with the pain in my hip, or whatever it is that's hurting me, that I don't say anything to him at all. I'm feeling guilty because I didn't have my seat belt on. I'm feeling that it's my fault entirely. <br><br>We get to the hospital and it's run by Paki-stani doctors. There's not an Irish doctor in sight, which is a little confusing for me because I suddenly feel like I'm in Pakistan. It's kind of hard to communicate. They speak English, but at the same time they don't have the same chatty bedside manner that the Irish have, at all. I was looking forward to the gift of gab to try to make me feel a little better. They're not paying any attention to Kathie, who's trying to give them advice about giving my head an MRI because I have this big bump on my head where I crashed into Kathie's head. Our heads collided and she got fourteen stitches and I got this bump. They won't do anything we request and Kathie was insisting on it and they were having a fight with her. She was in pain because the air bag had hit her and she had bruised muscles around her heart. They were writing notes on a piece of paper on her chest where the pain was. Kathie said, "Stop it, stop it, please. Where's your clipboard?" and the nurse says, "Well, we don't have one." <br><br>She's taken upstairs and put in a female dormitory, and I'm told that I have a broken acetabulum, that I'd chipped the acetabulum socket in my hip, and that I'd have to stay there in the hospital for six weeks, just in traction, and then I'd be better; I didn't need an operation. And then without any anesthesia at all they stuck this catheter in me. It was unbelievable. It made the pain of the broken hip seem mild. <br><br>It was a country hospital and they put me in a dormitory with five other men that are bashers and crashers, mainly, I think, farmers, or guys that have hit each other with trucks and tractors, for fun or out of drunkenness, and they're all boasting about it on their cell phones, because cell phones have taken over Ireland, as they have America. The cell phones are falling out of the bed constantly, crashing on the floor and lighting up with a little "Deet-deetle-deet-deet, deet deet," or "Be kind to your web-footed friends, for a duck may be somebody's mother." Every tune was different. I was completely disheveled because I had no pajamas, no toothbrush. I guess you have to carry those with you, the Irish do that, in case of an accident. Kathie said that the upstairs was so dirty she had to pee in the bathtub, because the toilets were unusable. <br><br>I'm not about to stay in there for six weeks, I know that, but I don't know how to get out. I feel like a prisoner. It was a shambles in there. <br><br>I had no orthopedic doctor, he was away for the weekend, so I'm in pain. They've got my foot hanging up, suspended, and they shoot me up with morphine and leave me there and in the middle of the night I woke up and hallucinated that I was in a Civil War battle, Antie-tam, and was wounded and was lying on a battle�eld with all these other wounded soldiers around me, these other groaning farmers. I'm near the window, thank God, the window's open-you get the scent of manure, and you can hear the cows grazing and magpies cawing in the most sinister way. It all reminded me of a Brueghel painting. <br><br>The next morning is Sunday morning and the priest comes through with the Holy Eucharist and I take my First Communion, what can I tell you. I think, Why not? Then a cross-dresser comes through, I swear, out of a Fellini movie. I will never forget her, it, he. He's got long green arti�cial �ngernails, balancing the toast between them, and he's going, "Toast! Tea! Toast!" "No, thank you, I'll pass," I said. Then a woman comes through with a clipboard, they �nally found one, and she's taking a survey: Do I want the hospital to be smoke-free?</p><h2>Blessed Is the Match: The Story of Jewish Resistance</h2><p>Records the Jewish resistance to Nazi mass murder during the war and to post-war efforts to block the rebirth of a Jewish state</p><p></p><h2>Tarot Fantastic</h2><p>A collection of tales encompasses the signs of the tarot deck and includes the story of a woman who gets more than she had bargained for when she turns to a street tarot reader for help in finding her missing brother.

The interdenominational mission was located in the heart of Cherokee country near present-day Chattanooga. For seven years the Brainerd missionaries kept a journal describing their lives and those of their charges. Although the journal has long been recognized as a significant primary document, it was not fully transcribed or made widely available until now. <p>The journal entries provide a richly textured and sensitive look at Cherokee life and American missionary activities during the early nineteenth century. They shed new light on the daily lives and personalities of individual Cherokees, as well as on poorly understood aspects of Cherokee politics and religion. The journal provides interesting ethnographic details concerning Cherokee council meetings, ceremonial occasions, gender relations, and the internal social and political tensions among families. Of equal interest are the complex and often conflicted attitudes of the missionaries, who were interested in Cherokee traditional culture but simultaneously worked to change it.</p></p><p>Joyce B.

I couldnt put it down PETER FRANKOPANOn a wet afternoon in September 1938, Neville Chamberlain stepped off an aeroplane and announced that his visit to Hitler had averted the greatest crisis in recent memory. It was, he later assured the crowd in Downing Street, peace for our time. Less than a year later, Germany invaded Poland and the Second World War began.Appeasing Hitler is a compelling new narrative history of the disastrous years of indecision, failed diplomacy and parliamentary infighting that enabled Nazi domination of Europe. Beginning with the advent of Hitler in 1933, it sweeps from the early days of the Third Reich to the beaches of Dunkirk. Bouverie takes us into the backrooms of 10 Downing Street and Parliament, where a small group of rebellious MPs, including the indomitable Winston Churchill, were among the few to realise that the only choice was between war now or war later. And we enter the drawing rooms and dining clubs of fading imperial Britain, where Hitler enjoyed surprising support among the ruling class and even some members of the Royal Family.Drawing on deep archival research, including previously unseen sources, this is an unforgettable portrait of the ministers, aristocrats and amateur diplomats who, through their actions and inaction, shaped their country&#39;s policy and determined the fate of Europe. Both sweeping and intimate, Appeasing Hitler is not only eye-opening history but a timeless lesson on the challenges of standing up to aggression and authoritarianism and the calamity that results from failing to do so.</p><p></p><h2>The Great Man: Sir Robert Walpole: Scoundrel, Genius and Britain&#39;s First Prime Minister</h2><p>The year 1721 has many splendors, but there are also&nbsp;13 public hanging days a year, drunkenness is endemic, and organized crime rampages through the streets. Only a generation earlier James II, suspected of conspiring to enforce Roman Catholicism and subordinate England to France, was driven out by the Whigs. In 1715 his son, the Pretender, failed to take the Crown by armed force. The new King, George I, an intelligent, moderate man, is cursed everywhere as a damned foreigner. James's followers, the Jacobites, conspire and are persecuted. In 1720, the South Sea Bubble, an attempt to finance state debt by runaway speculation, collapses. Ruined people mass in Westminster. The South Sea directors, says an MP, should be thrown into the sea. The Pretender could take over any day. Robert Walpole, once imprisoned for financial chicanery, assumes political control. When the rage subsides he becomes chief minister&#x2014;or, a new title, "Prime Minister." He personally detects a Jacobite plot. Digging in, he buys parliamentary seats wholesale with secret service money. In a runaway theatrical success, "The Beggar's Opera", Walpole is compared with the criminal mastermind Jonathan Wild. But he will dominate King, Parliament, and Government until 1742. Dismissed in 1727 on the death of George I, he recruits the new King's clever wife, Caroline, and bounces cheerfully back. Coarse, corrupt, and cynical, Walpole sits on the Treasury Bench munching little Norfolk apples sent from the estate he is enlarging with political profit. This is Mr. Worldlywiseman, keeping England out of war for&nbsp;20 years and setting up a stable and growing economy. All politics of a kind we can recognize begin with Robert Walpole. And here, in Edward Pearce's elegant book, he is brought vividly back to life.</p><p>Edward Pearce, after a national newspaper career starting in 1977, still keeps his hand in with book reviews, obituaries and travel pieces. his early books include Contemporary Political Comment and Satire, The Senate of Lilliput, Hummingbirds and Hyenas, Looking Down on Mrs Thatcher, The Shooting Gallery, The Quiet Rise of John Major, Election Rides and Machiavelli&#39;s Children. However, for several years now he has concentrated on writing history. The Lost Leaders (about three near-Prime Ministers) was followed by Lines of Most Resistance (about English Resistance to Irish Home Rule), Denis Heaney (the authorised biography), Reform! (about the 1832 Act), and The Diaries of Charles Greville, both published in Pimlico. He lives in North Yorkshire.&#34;Edward Pearce is a magnificent historian, and his biography of Sir Robert Walpole, the first British Prime Minister, is superb.&#34; -- Iain Sprout Scotland on Sunday &#34;It is hard to imagine how anyone could rival this author&#39;s unparalleled expertise on prime ministers and politics, which makes him a lucid guide through the arcane maze of 18th-century government.&#34; -- Frank McLynn Independent &#34;Richly detailed, stylistically ornate and littered with eccentric asides.&#34; Sunday Telegraph &#34;Masterly.&#34; Mail on Sunday &#34;This is serious history...consistently illuminated by Pearce&#39;s sharp prose.&#34; Sunday Express</p><h2>The Houseplant Care Manual : The Complete Guide to Choosing, Nurturing and Displaying Houseplants</h2><p>This book is full of up to date advice on choosing beautiful houseplants and keeping them in tip-top condition, revealing all the secrets of success.</p><p></p><h2>The Battle of the River Plate: The Hunt for the German Pocket Battleship Graf Spee</h2><p>This tale of the Battle of the River Plate follows the machinations of the German war machine as Kapitan zur See Hans Langsdorff commands the pocket battleship Graf Spee on a mission to cripple British shipping.

He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of sixteen and spent much of his early life at sea. He was torpedoed during the Second World War and resulting spinal injuries plagued him for the rest of his life. Towards the end of the war Pope turned to journalism, becoming the Naval and Defence Correspondent for the &#39;London Evening News&#39;. At this time he also researched naval history and in time became an authority on the Napoleonic era and Nelson&#39;s exploits, resulting in several well received volumes, especially on the Battles of Copenhagen and Trafalgar. Encouraged by Hornblower creator CS Forester, he also began writing fiction using his own experiences in the Navy and his extensive historical research as a basis. In 1965, he wrote &#39;Ramage&#39;, the first of his highly successful series of novels following the exploits of the heroic &#39;Lord Nicholas Ramage&#39; during the Napoleonic Wars. Another renowned series is centred on &#39;Ned Yorke&#39;, a buccaneer in the seventeenth century Caribbean and then with a descendant following the &#39;Yorke&#39; family naval tradition when involved in realistic secret operations during the Second World War. Dudley Pope lived aboard boats whenever possible, along with his wife and daughter, and this was where he wrote the majority of his novels. Most of his adult life was spent in the Caribbean and in addition to using the locale for fictional settings he also wrote authoritatively on naval history of the region, including a biography of the buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan. He died in 1997 aged seventy one. &#39;The first and still favourite rival to Hornblower&#39; - Daily Mirror"One of the great naval engagements of all time . . .

Whether you want to settle those arguments about the difference between a kit and a caboodle, or just curious about dry cleaning, Teflon, Wayne Gretzky, or chocolate bunnies, <i>Why Do Clocks Run Clockwise?</i> is indispensable.</p></p><p>David Feldman is the author of <i>Imponderables</i> and <i>How to Win at Just About Everything.</i> He has a masters degree in popular culture from Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Formerly in the programming department of NBC-TV, he consults and lectures on the media and writes about a wide range of popular culture.From his book of "imponderables"--explanations of everyday phenomena--author David Feldman has selected two dozen questions that he adapts into an interactive multiple-choice quiz game. The format is ingenious, taking all passivity out of the listening experience. Feldman serves as host and moderator, with three actors playing the panelists, named "A" "B" and "C," who provide three possible answers to each imponderable. After a ten-second musical interlude, the listener must choose between the answers, testing wits with the panelists, after which Feldman provides the correct explanation. Even for those who have never thought about why some eggs are brown, why aluminum foil is shiny on only one side, or what makes whips crack, listeners young and old will enjoy this truly interactive audio game show.

Queen Levana from "The Lunar Chronicles'" (Feiwel &amp; Friends) is more than a beautiful villain. In this prequel, Meyer explains how she went from lonely, shy second daughter to the most feared and relentless woman in the universe. Levana grew up in the shadow of her distant mother, Queen Jannali, and her vengeful older sister, Princess Channary. After the murder of their parents, Channary takes the crown and produces an heir, Selene. Having permanently assumed a glamour, or altered physical appearance, after a childhood "accident" caused by Channary resulted in a severe disfigurement, Levana coerces a widowed palace guard to marry her, bringing his young daughter Winter to the palace. Her older sister's unexpected death catapults Levana to the position of Queen Regent&#x2014;but that isn't enough for the ambitious, entitled protagonist. Meyer successfully sketches in some humanity to Levana's actions. At times, her raw loneliness invokes short-lived sympathy, such as when Levana clings to a dented pendant given to her by her husband. Even if readers despise her, it is worth reading this interim background novel to gain insight into Levana's complex character.

At school he was good at art but didn&#x2019;t think of a career in illustration until he won a cuddly purple cow in a drawing competition. He moved to England in 1982 to learn English and to study illustration at the Bath Academy of Art and has since illustrated a number of books, including <i>A Squash and a Squeeze, The Gruffalo, </i>and <i>Room on the Broom, </i>all written by Julia Donaldson, as well as the popular Pip and Posy series. His books have been translated into forty-two languages. He lives in London with his partner and young daughter.<b> </b>PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;There's something undeniably goofy and cheery about the art of Scheffler, author of the "Pip and Posy" books (Nosy Crow), and illustrator of Julia Donaldson's "Gruffalo" titles (Dial), among others. Those googly eyes and oddly expressive faces of the characters he draws, whether human or animal, and even their stances (think: the Gruffalo walking thru the wood) can't help but make readers smile. Add in an abundance of bright colors and amusing details, and his pictures are a guaranteed delight. Each spread of the sturdy spiral-bound Safari features two large-print four-line stanzas on the left and a full-page image of a creature featuring Scheffler trademark art on the right. Each picture includes a few words indicating one of the sounds these wild animals might make (e.g., "Roar! Roar!" for the lion, "Munch! Munch!" for the giraffe). The humorous verses offer a few details about the creature's anatomy, senses, sound, speed, or behavior (re: the warthog: "My snout has lots of lumps and bumps;/my tusks are sharp and short./I swish my tail and flap my ears/ and give a great big snort.") The pages are split in two horizontally, allowing readers&#x2014;with a flip or a flap&#x2014;to make some curious creatures such as the girah (half giraffe, half cheetah) or the wartelope (half warthog, half antelope). Since the second group of stanzas on each page focus on legs, movement, or color of the animal's coat, they pair up nicely with the newly made fantastical creatures. An interactive iPad version of the book (Nosy Crow, 2014) is also available.

A graduate of Princeton University, he lives in Bemidji, MinnesotaAn empty coffin is lowered into a grave behind a half-abandoned housing project called Poverty on an Indian reservation in northern Minnesota. The burial ceremony is for an enigmatic eight-year-old boy named Little, whose entire vocabulary consists of the word you. First novelist Treuer reconstructs Little's biography by allowing Poverty's inhabitants to tell their own life stories in a mosaic of first-person narratives. In the process, we learn the history of Poverty itself, from the turn of the century to the present.

It was nearly midnight when the doors of the wooden, one-story church swung open releasing streams of worshippers, all African American, into the moonlight. After a night of singing and praying, Recy Taylor, Fannie Daniel, and Daniel&#x2019;s eighteen year- old son, West, stepped out of the country chapel and strolled toward home alongside the peanut plantations that bounded the Abbeville-Headland highway. Taylor, a slender, copper-colored, and beautiful twenty-four-year-old mother and sharecropper, noticed a rattletrap green Chevrolet pass them at least three times, young white men gawking from its windows.<br><br>&#x201c;You reckon what they are up to?&#x201d; Taylor asked.<br><br>Taylor and Daniel, a stout sixty- one- year- old woman, watched the car creep by one last time and roll to a stop a few feet ahead of them. Seven men, armed with knives and guns, got out of the car and walked toward the women. Herbert Lovett, the oldest of the crew at twenty- four and a private in the U.S. Army, shouted, &#x201c;Halt!&#x201d;<br><br>When they ignored the order, Lovett leveled his shotgun. West tugged at his mother&#x2019;s sleeve, begging her to stop. &#x201c;They might shoot you,&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br>As the circle of men closed in, Lovett waved his gun at Taylor.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking for this girl, right there. She&#x2019;s the one that cut that white boy in Clopton this evening,&#x201d; Lovett said, adding that the local sheriff, George H. Gamble, had dispatched the group to find the alleged assailant.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong,&#x201d; Fannie insisted. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been to my house all day.&#x201d;<br><br>The men crowded closer, nodding their heads in agreement. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t this her?&#x201d; Lovett asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yep, this the one,&#x201d; Joe Culpepper said. &#x201c;I know her by the clothes she got on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her,&#x201d; Luther Lee agreed. &#x201c;Get her!&#x201d;<br><br>Lovett lurched toward Taylor and grabbed her arm. Then he turned to West and asked if Taylor was his wife.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; West replied, &#x201c;she&#x2019;s Willie Guy Taylor&#x2019;s wife.&#x201d; Undeterred, Lovett extended his hand to the teenager, ordered him to shake it, and promised not to hurt Taylor.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to take her up here and see if Mr. Gamble knows her,&#x201d; Lovett claimed. &#x201c;If she&#x2019;s not the one, we&#x2019;ll bring her right back.&#x201d;<br>As Lovett spoke, Taylor managed to wrest her arm from his grasp and bolted toward a stand of trees behind a cabin.1<br><br>&#x201c;Come back! Come back!&#x201d; Fannie yelled. &#x201c;They going to shoot you. Come back!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; Lovett shouted. He cocked the gun at the back of her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll kill you if you run.&#x201d;<br><br>Lovett walked Taylor to the car and shoved her into the backseat. Three men piled in behind her, while four others squeezed into the front. The headlights switched off and the car crept away. After a few miles, the green sedan turned off the main highway, rattled down a red-clay tractor path into the woods, and stopped in a grove of pecan trees. &#x201c;Y&#x2019;all aren&#x2019;t carrying me to Mr. Gamble,&#x201d; Taylor shouted. The men in the backseat clasped her wrists and ordered her to be quiet. Lovett grabbed his gun and waved Taylor and his companions out of the car.<br><br>&#x201c;Get them rags off,&#x201d; he barked, pointing the shotgun at her, &#x201c;or I&#x2019;ll kill you and leave you down here in the woods.&#x201d;<br><br>Sobbing, Taylor pulled off her clothes.<br><br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;let me go home to my husband and my baby.&#x201d;<br><br>Lovett spread an old hunting coat on the ground, told his friends to strip down to their socks and undershirts, and ordered Taylor to lie down.<br><br>Lovett passed his rifle to a friend and took off his pants. Hovering over the young mother, he snarled, &#x201c;Act just like you do with your husband or I&#x2019;ll cut your damn throat.&#x201d;<br><br>. . .<br><br>Lovett was the first of six men to rape Taylor that night. When they finished, someone helped her get dressed, tied a handkerchief over her eyes, and shoved her back into the car. Back on the highway, the men stopped and ordered Taylor out of the car. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move until we get away from here,&#x201d; one of them yelled. Taylor heard the car disappear into the night. She pulled off the blindfold, got her bearings, and began the long walk home.<br>A few days later, a telephone rang at the NAACP branch office in Montgomery, Alabama. E. D. Nixon, the local president, promised to send his best investigator to Abbeville. That investigator would launch a movement that would ultimately change the world.<br>Her name was Rosa Parks.<br>In later years, historians would paint Parks as a sweet and reticent old woman, whose tired feet caused her to defy Jim Crow on Montgomery&#x2019;s city buses. Her solitary and spontaneous act, the story goes, sparked the 1955 bus boycott and gave birth to the civil rights movement. But Rosa Parks was a militant race woman, a sharp detective, and an antirape activist long before she became the patron saint of the bus boycott. After meeting with Recy Taylor, Rosa Parks helped form the Committee for Equal Justice. With support from local people, she helped organize what the<i> Chicago Defender</i> called the &#x201c;strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade.&#x201d; Eleven years later this group of homegrown leaders would become better known as the Montgomery Improvement Association. The 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, often heralded as the opening scene of the civil rights movement, was in many ways the last act of a decades-long struggle to protect black women, like Taylor, from sexualized violence and rape.<br>The kidnapping and rape of Recy Taylor was not unusual in the segregated South. The sexual exploitation of black women by white men had its roots in slavery and continued throughout the better part of the twentieth century.<br><br>When African Americans tested their freedom during Reconstruction, former slaveholders and their sympathizers used rape as a &#x201c;weapon of terror&#x201d; to dominate the bodies and minds of African-American men and women. Interracial rape was not only used to uphold white patriarchal power but was also deployed as a justification for lynching black men who challenged the Southern status quo. In addition to the immediate physical danger African Americans faced, sexual and racial violence functioned as a tool of coercion, control, and harassment. Ida B. Wells, the guntoting editor of the <i>Memphis Free Press</i> who led a crusade against lynching in the 1890s, argued that white men accused black men of rape as part of a larger &#x201c;system of intimidation&#x201d; designed to keep blacks &#x201c;subservient and submissive.&#x201d; Worse, Wells argued at the turn of the century, white men used the protection of white womanhood to &#x201c;justify their own barbarism.&#x201d;<br><br>The rape of black women by white men continued, often unpunished, throughout the Jim Crow era. As Reconstruction collapsed and Jim Crow arose, white men abducted and assaulted black women with alarming regularity. White men lured black women and girls away from home with promises of steady work and better wages; attacked them on the job; abducted them at gunpoint while traveling to or from home, work, or church; raped them as a form of retribution or to enforce rules of racial and economic hierarchy; sexually humiliated and assaulted them on streetcars and buses, in taxicabs and trains, and in other public spaces. As the acclaimed freedom fighter Fannie Lou Hamer put it, &#x201c;A black woman&#x2019;s body was never hers alone.&#x201d;<br><br>Black women did not keep their stories secret. African- American women reclaimed their bodies and their humanity by testifying about their assaults. They launched the first public attacks on sexual violence as a &#x201c;systemic abuse of women&#x201d; in response to slavery and the wave of lynchings in the post-Emancipation South. Slave narratives offer stark testimony about the brutal sexual exploitation bondswomen faced. For example, Harriet Jacobs detailed her master&#x2019;s lechery in her autobiography to &#x201c;arouse the women of the North&#x201d; and &#x201c;convince the people of the Free States what Slavery really is.&#x201d; When African- American clubwomen began to organize antilynching campaigns during the late nineteenth century, they testified about decades of sexual abuse. On October 5, 1892, hundreds of black women converged on Lyric Hall in New York City to hear Ida B. Wells&#x2019;s thunderous voice. While black men were being accused of ravishing white women, she argued, &#x201c;The rape of helpless Negro girls, which began in slavery days, still continues without reproof from church, state or press.&#x201c; At the 1893 World&#x2019;s Fair in Chicago, Fannie Barrier Williams told an audience of black and white clubwomen about the &#x201c;shameful fact that I am constantly in receipt of letters from the still unprotected women of the South. . . .&#x201d; Anna Julia Cooper, a Washington, D.C., educator, author, and respected clubwoman, echoed Williams&#x2019;s testimony. Black women, she told the crowd, were engaged in a &#x201c;painful, patient, and silent toil . . . to gain title to the bodies of their daughters.&#x201d;<br><br>Throughout the twentieth century, black women persisted in telling their stories, frequently cited in local and national NAACP reports. Their testimonies spilled out in letters to the Justice Department and appeared on the front pages of the nation&#x2019;s leading black newspapers. Black women regularly denounced their sexual misuse. By deploying their voices as weapons in the wars against white supremacy, whether in the church, the courtroom, or in congressional hearings, African- American women loudly resisted what Martin Luther King, Jr., called the &#x201c;thingification&#x201d; of their humanity. Decades before radical feminists in the women&#x2019;s movement urged rape survivors to &#x201c;speak out,&#x201d; African-American women&#x2019;s public protests galvanized local, national, and even international outrage and sparked larger campaigns for racial justice and human dignity. When Recy Taylor spoke out against her assailants and Rosa Parks and her allies in Montgomery mobilized in defense of her womanhood in 1944, they joined<br>this tradition of testimony and protest. <br><br>Montgomery, Alabama, was not the only place in which attacks on black women fueled protests against white supremacy. Between 1940 and 1975, sexual violence and interracial rape became one crucial battleground upon which African Americans sought to destroy white supremacy and gain personal and political autonomy. Civil rights campaigns in Little Rock, Arkansas; Macon, Georgia; Tallahassee, Florida; Washington, North Carolina; Birmingham and Selma, Alabama; Hattiesburg, Mississippi; and many other places had roots in organized resistance to sexual violence and appeals for protection of black womanhood.<br><br>And yet analyses of rape and sexualized violence play little or no role in most histories of the civil rights movement, which present it as a struggle between black and white men&#x2014;the heroic leadership of Martin Luther King confronting intransigent white supremacists like &#x201c;Bull&#x201d; Connor. The real story&#x2014;that the civil rights movement is also rooted in African-American women&#x2019;s long struggle against sexual violence&#x2014;has never before been written. The stories of black women who fought for bodily integrity and personal dignity hold profound truths about the sexualized violence that marked racial politics and African American lives during the modern civil rights movement. If we understand the role rape and sexual violence played in African Americans&#x2019; daily lives and within the larger freedom struggle, we have to reinterpret, if not rewrite, the history of the civil rights movement. At the <i>Dark End of the Street</i> does both.<br><br>It is no surprise that buses became the target of African- American resistance in Montgomery during the 1955&#x2013;56 boycott. It was much easier, not to mention safer, for black women to stop riding the buses than it was to bring their assailants&#x2014;usually white policemen or bus drivers&#x2014;to justice. By walking hundreds of miles to protest humiliation and testifying publicly about physical and sexual abuse, black women reclaimed their bodies and demanded to be treated with dignity and respect. Coupling new historical evidence with a fresh perspective, Chapters 2 and 3 reveal the history of the Montgomery campaign as a women&#x2019;s movement<br>for dignity.<br><br>Issues of sexual violence were crucial both to the civil rights movement and to the white supremacist resistance. Segregationists responded to the nascent African-American freedom movement with a sexually charged campaign of terror to derail the freedom movement. Between 1956 and 1960, black Southerners braved the Ku Klux Klan, the White Citizens&#x2019; Council, and other extremist groups, sparking some of the fiercest struggles for black humanity of the modern civil rights movement. These battles, highlighted in Chapter 4, exposed the power of sex in maintaining the South&#x2019;s racial hierarchy and underscored the extent to which whites<br>would fight to preserve it.<br><br>Often ignored by civil rights historians, a number of campaigns led to trials and even convictions throughout the South. These cases, many virtually unknown, broke with Southern tradition and fractured the philosophical and political foundations of white supremacy by challenging the relationship between sexual domination and racial equality. <br><br>Nowhere was this more apparent and more important than in Tallahassee, Florida, where Betty Jean Owens, an African-American college student, stood in front of an all- white jury in 1959 and testified about being kidnapped and gang-raped by four white men. The extraordinary trial, the subject of Chapter 5, focused national attention on the sexual exploitation of African-American women. For perhaps the first time since Reconstruction, black Southerners could imagine government as a defender of their manhood and womanhood. The Tallahassee case led to rape convictions elsewhere that year in Montgomery, Alabama; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Burton, South Carolina. The 1959 Tallahassee rape was a watershed case that remains as revealing now as it was important then. <br><br>Black women&#x2019;s testimonies revealed their vulnerability across the South, especially in Mississippi. Most accounts of the Mississippi movement focus on racist brutality directed at men&#x2014;from Emmett Till and Medgar Evers to Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, and James Chaney. Chapter 6 challenges the dominant historical narrative of the Mississippi freedom struggle by documenting black women&#x2019;s resistance to racial <i>and</i> sexual abuse.<br><br>The 1965 Selma, Alabama, campaign, like the Montgomery movement, has an important history rooted in sexualized violence that historians have not yet explored. Federal intervention and congressional action on behalf of African Americans in 1964 and 1965&#x2014;especially the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act&#x2014;constituted the most dangerous threat to white dominion and left segregationists reeling. But the segregationists fired back with traditional ammunition of sexual slander and the &#x201c;black beast rapist.&#x201d; Chapter 7 documents how white supremacists in Selma and across the South used the rhetoric of rape and &#x201c;miscegenation&#x201d; to resuscitate and revive massive resistance, underscoring the importance of sex and sexual violence to the maintenance of white supremacy. Civil rights activists were not only &#x201c;outside agitators&#x201d; or Communists intent on destroying the Southern way of life; now they were sexual fiends. It was within this storm&#x2014;and because of it&#x2014;that the Ku Klux Klan murdered Viola Liuzzo, a white housewife from Detroit who embraced the black freedom struggle. Her detractors, of course, accused her of embracing black men.<br><br>An analysis of sex and sexualized violence in well- known civil rights narratives changes the historical markers and meanings of the movement. Like the Tallahassee case, the 1965 trial of Norman Cannon, a white man who abducted and raped a black teenager in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, had broad implications for both the Miss...</p><h2>Looking for the Lost Gods of England</h2><p>An examination of the royal genealogies, charms, verse and other sources in an attempt to find the names and attributes of the gods and goddesses of the early Anglo-Saxons.

All at once, <br>around Thanksgiving, America decided it didn"t want to cook anymore. From <br>upscale food magazines to newspaper food sections and even news <br>magazines, publications were loaded with bright ideas on how not to cook <br>and get away with it. This 180-degree turnaround goes by several names: <br>faking it, semi-homemade (that"s TV cook Sandra Lee), can-opener gourmet. <br>We shuddered at the very idea of giving up cooking for Thanksgiving, which <br>struck us as positively un-American.<br> But once we thought about it, we concluded that breaking all the <br>rules and making creative use of what"s available is a completely American <br>thing to do &#x2014; at Thanksgiving or any other time of the year. And then we <br>realized that in making the selections for this series, we ourselves have <br>always been devoted to the smart shortcut recipe, not to mention using high-<br>quality convenience foods to speed things along.<br> Few recipes in this book delight us as much as Garlicky Potato <br>Chips (doctored commercial chips) or Instant Black Beans, a fast take on the <br>Brazilian classic. Quick-cooking grits turn out to be just great in the right <br>hands, much to our amazement. Bobby Flay"s no-fuss turkey is a winner, as <br>is Nigella Lawson"s nearly instant Bitter Orange Ice Cream (and no, you don"t <br>need an ice cream machine). As long as the results are worth it, we"re all in <br>favor of the quick fix, and we"ve got plenty of quick fixes in this book.<br> In America, there"s usually a diametrically opposite trend for <br>everything, and food is no exception. If we don"t want Grandma"s <br>Thanksgiving anymore, we do want her recipes. This year we were inundated <br>with great hand-me-downs, from aunts and dads as well as grandmothers. <br>Among our favorites are a terrific French creamy chocolate cake, a fabulous <br>spaghettini with tuna and raisins, and a blueberry cobbler that"s the best <br>we"ve ever tasted. These heirloom recipes fall into the category of dishes we <br>can"t stop making, an occupational hazard of putting this book together.<br> Instead of keeping these passions to ourselves, we"ve decided to <br>share them. We"re adding a new category to our list of top ten this year: our <br>own favorite recipes from the book. The fact is, though, whether the source is <br>a tag on a gadget, a radio station"s Web site, a chef"s cookbook, a food <br>magazine, or a regional newspaper, we love every recipe in this book and will <br>make them all again, our test of something really good. And we think you too <br>will find dozens of doable recipes that you"ll return to, some of them so <br>insanely simple that you"ll want to share them with your noncooking friends.<br><br>&#x2014; FRAN MC CULLOUGH<br>and MOLLY STEVENS<br><br>breakfast and brunch<br><br>Eggs with Crunchy Bread Crumbs 72<br>Baked Eggs and Mushrooms in Ham Crisps 74<br>Creamy Scrambled Eggs for a Crowd 76<br>George Davis"s Pancakes 78<br>Amazing Overnight Waffles 80<br>Buttermilk Scones 82<br>Never-a-Leftover Breakfast Bread Pudding 84<br>Sausage and Cheese Grits Casserole 86<br><br>SOURCE: The Zuni Cafe Cookbook by Judy Rodgers<br>COOK: Judy Rodgers<br>Eggs with Crunchy Bread Crumbs<br><br>Just when you think there"s no new way in the world to cook<br>something so simple as a fried egg, along comes this delightful recipe, in<br>which the eggs are cooked right over crisp bread crumbs. The combination of<br>the familiar floppy eggs, the rich yolks, the crunchy crumbs, and a final sizzle<br>of vinegar is amazingly good. Judy Rodgers likes to have these eggs for <br>dinner<br>when she"s eating alone, but the dish also appears on the lunch menu at her<br>San Francisco restaurant, Zuni Cafe, accompanied by bacon or sausage and<br>grilled vegetables or roasted mushrooms.<br>You"ll need a very large pan or two pans to make this dish for four. This is<br>a terrific breakfast for houseguests.<br><br>serves 1<br><br>3 tablespoons packed bread crumbs (see note)<br>Salt<br>About 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>A few fresh thyme or marjoram leaves (optional)<br>2 large eggs<br>About 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, or sherry vinegar<br><br>Sprinkle the bread crumbs with salt to taste in a small bowl and add enough <br>olive oil to just oversaturate them.<br><br>Add the crumbs to a 6- or 8-inch French steel omelet pan or nonstick skillet <br>over medium heat. (If you like your eggs over easy, reserve some of the oiled <br>crumbs to sprinkle over the eggs just before you flip them.) Let the crumbs <br>warm through, then swirl the pan as they begin drying out &#x2014; they"ll make a <br>quiet, staticky sound. Stir once or twice.<br><br>The moment you see the crumbs begin to color, quickly add the remaining oil <br>and the thyme or marjoram, if using, then crack the eggs directly onto the <br>crumbs. Cook the eggs as you like them.<br><br>Slide the eggs onto a warm plate. Immediately add the vinegar to the pan, <br>swirling it once. Pour the sizzling vinegar over the eggs and serve.<br><br>cook"s notes<br><br>*By "bread crumbs," Rodgers doesn"t mean the kind you buy in a container <br>at the supermarket. She"s talking about good chewy peasant bread, such as <br>ciabatta, that"s slightly stale. You can grate the crumbs by hand or in a food <br>processor. If you"re making the eggs for more than four people, it"s easiest to <br>prepare the crumbs ahead in the oven instead of the skillet. Toast them in a <br>425-degree oven until they are the color of weak tea, then scatter them in the <br>skillet and proceed with the rest of the olive oil and the eggs.<br><br>* The herbs are a very nice touch, if you have them available. Rodgers also <br>suggests rosemary, but we found it a little strong for this dish. You can also <br>add a subtle garlic flavor by rubbing the bread with a cut clove of garlic before <br>you grate the crumbs.<br><br>* Making this dish is a bit like making a stir-fry: have everything at hand, and <br>you won"t have any trouble. If you"re searching for the vinegar or plucking the <br>herbs at the last minute, things can get tricky.<br><br>SOURCE: Gourmet<br>COOK: Lori W.

The recipe is easily <br>scaled up or down accordingly, as long as you have the right number of <br>muffin tins. Small ramekins work too.

Lightly oil twelve 1/2-cup muffin cups. Heat <br>the butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, <br>shallots, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are tender <br>and the liquid they give off has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from <br>the heat and stir in the cr�me fra�che or sour cream and tarragon.<br><br>Fit a slice of ham into each of the 12 muffin cups (the ends will stick up and <br>hang over the edges of the cups). Divide the mushrooms among the cups and <br>crack 1 egg into each. Bake in the middle of the oven until the egg whites are <br>cooked but yolks are still runny, about 15 minutes. Season the eggs with <br>salt and pepper. Lift from the muffin cups carefully using 2 spoons or small <br>spatulas. Serve immediately on the brioche or other toast, garnished with <br>tarragon leaves.<br><br>cook"s notes<br><br>* For a quicker version, try the recipe without the mushrooms &#x2014; just a thin <br>slice of ham cradling a single baked egg. Or play around with other fillings, <br>such as a bit of leftover saut�ed spinach or creamed chicken &#x2014; but nothing <br>too watery.<br><br>* If you make the mushrooms ahead, let them come to room temperature or <br>add a few minutes to the baking time.<br><br>* If you don"t have fresh tarragon on hand, use a scant teaspoon of dried and <br>skip the garnish.<br><br>* If there are holes or tears in the ham slices, overlap or patch them as best <br>you can.<br><br>* The eggs come out with runny yolks and just-set whites. If you like your <br>eggs cooked more, just leave them in the oven for a few minutes longer.<br><br>tip<br><br>If you find that you"re always fishing bits of shell out of the egg after you <br>crack it, you might try this advice from Alton Brown in I"m Just Here for the <br>Food. Instead of cracking an egg on the edge of a bowl, which drives the <br>shell fragments into the egg, try cracking it with a flat blow on the counter.

The <br>technique worked like a charm.

W. Apple in the New York Times, the scrambled eggs at <br>Bill"s caf� in Sydney, Australia, have been described as the best scrambled <br>eggs in the world. The secret to getting them soft, creamy, and amazingly <br>light is in the technique. To serve 1 or 2 people, melt a sliver of butter in a <br>nonstick skillet over high heat. Whisk together 2 eggs, 1/2 cup cream, and a <br>pinch or two of salt. (It"s best if the eggs and cream are at room <br>temperature.) Add the egg mixture to the skillet and do nothing for 20 <br>seconds, then very slowly fold and stir the eggs with a wooden spoon, and <br>pause for 20 seconds more. Repeat the gentle stir-and-fold, then remove the <br>skillet from the heat and let the residual heat finish the cooking. Give one last <br>gentle stir and serve.

Well, <br>these pancakes are a happy exception to that rule. They come out beautifully <br>browned, with lightly crispy edges and fluffy, soft insides &#x2014; picture-perfect &#x2014; <br>and they taste as good as they look. The two tricks are vinegar and bacon <br>fat. The bit of vinegar in the batter interacts with the baking soda and gives <br>the cakes their light texture. And frying them in bacon fat gives the exterior a <br>light crunch that you don"t get with butter.<br><br>serves 6<br><br>2 cups all-purpose flour<br>2 teaspoons baking powder<br>1 teaspoon baking soda<br>1 teaspoon salt<br>2 cups milk<br>3 large eggs<br>1/4 cup canola oil<br>2 tablespoons white vinegar<br>3 tablespoons bacon fat<br>Maple syrup, for serving<br><br>Whisk together the dry ingredients in a large bowl.<br><br>Whisk together the milk, eggs, and oil in a medium bowl.

Using a 2-ounce ladle (or 1/4-cup measure) for <br>each pancake, pour the batter into the skillet. When bubbles start to form on <br>the tops of the pancakes and the edges look set, flip.

Royalty, nobility and commoners competed for livestock prizes at agricultural shows up and down the country. Animals of extraordinary dimensions were toured in horse-drawn caravans over nearly impassable roads to entertain the crowds who flocked to see them. Debates were waged in the national press over the relative merits of one breed versus another and never before or since has the country boasted so many different breeds of farm animals.<br>The livestock portraits of the day form the only record of many of these early breeds which are now endangered, extinct or changed beyond recognition. The paintings were commissioned by proud breeders to impress friends, clients and the world at large with their improved breeds and show ring triumphs. The illustrations have been gathered together from museums and private collections up and down the country, ranging from stately mansions to humble cottages. This book explains the unique conditions which gave rise to such an extraordinary school of painting and looks closely at the artists, many of them little known, who specialised in this genre. It also examines the development of our native breeds of cattle, sheep, pigs, horses and poultry.<br>This is the first comprehensive study of an exceptional period in livestock experimentation and of the social and economic aspirations which led to the commissioning of these paintings. Over four hundred illustrations (325 in full colour) provide a unique record of rare or extinct animals which once grazed these lands. This book will have a wide general appeal and will particularly attract enthusiasts of folk and primitive art as well as those whose interest is in rare and vanished breeds.</p><p>Focusing on British works, this volume chronicles a unique school of painting that bore witness to the intense competition in the late 18th and 19th centuries for breeding the fattest farm animals. In an age when fat was used for many purposes, there was considerable pressure to obtain livestock prizes?the size of some of the animals pictured here is truly incredible?and a commensurate desire of winners to record their achievements. The author describes the artistic and agricultural background of this genre, then discusses livestock painting from 1780 to 1900. The final five chapters discuss developments in breeding various farm animals. The paintings are of a very high quality, and the reproductions are faithful to the original. Moreover, the scenes are interesting, revealing farm and social life in the country. In addition to being informative, the volume breaks new ground in illuminating a little-known field of British painting.

A man who proudly boasts experiencing more than 4,800 sexual encounters in his lifetime, Simmons is perfectly suited to document the one profession that has been embroiled in controversy throughout history as we know it. &#34;In good times and in bad times,&#34; Simmons writes, &#34;ladies of the night will always do well.&#34;</p><p>Gene Simmons was born a very poor Chaim Witz in Israel in 1949, and immigrated with his divorced mother to Brooklyn in 1958. Thrilled by comic books, The Ed Sullivan Show, and rock and roll, Simmons ultimately decided that people crave great rock and roll music and a great theatrical show. People crave excitement and escape from their everyday lives. This inspiration led Simmons to create the most enduring sound in rock music history.Fans of the band KISS won&#39;t be shocked by LADIES OF THE NIGHT, Kiss bassist and reality-TV star Gene Simmons&#39;s &#34;tribute&#34; to one of his favorite subjects: prostitution. Despite his reputation as a womanizer not exactly sympathetic to feminist causes, Simmons&#39;s book, in its own strangely sincere way, pays homage to prostitutes throughout the ages--from the concubines of ancient Rome to the courtesans of France to the brothels of New Orleans. Given his reputation, the fact that the author himself reads the work lends it an almost lewd aspect, but this is no sleazy leering oratory. When he&#39;s not growling heavy-metal lyrics, Simmons is actually a smooth enunciator. Simmons&#39;s suave tone elevates the work, removing the titillating aspects and making LADIES OF THE NIGHT a legitimate history of sex for sale.

Hers is a story little discussed in Native American history books. Instead, much of what is known of her has been passed down through generations via stories and legends. <br><br>For example, it is said that she was embued with supernatural powers, given to her by the gods. She would lift her arms to the sky and place her palms against the wind, and through the heat she felt in her open hands, she could detect the direction and distance of her enemies. Whether true or not, she did ride into battle alongside Geronimo in the Apache wars, and fought bitterly and savagely until she was captured along with her people, packed into railroad cars, and sent to imprisonment in the east, where she spent her last days.<br><br>Peter Aleshire uses historical facts and oral histories to recreate her life. With immaculate detail he tells the story of her childhood, surrounded by the vastness of nature and the Chiricahua legends and religions that shaped her thoughts. He describes her coming-of-age ceremonies, and induction into her tribe as a spiritual leader. As the white men slowly took over the land of her people and forced them from one reservation to another, her role slowly evolved to match that of the staunchest warrior -- an almost unheard-of occurence among the Native Americans of the 19th century, where a woman's place was with the children in the villages.<br><br>This is not only the story of Lozen, but the story of her people, from the events leading up to the Apache Wars until their inevitable and unfortunate conclusion.<br></p><p>Peter Aleshire is a respected and prolific journalist and author of two books, Reaping the Whirlwind and The Fox and the Whirlwind. He teaches in the Department of American Studies at Arizona State University.<br>Little has been written about Lozen, an Apache woman of the late 19th century; even oral accounts are scarce. Yet in this meticulously footnoted conjectural history of the warrior and shaman, Aleshire (The Fox and the Whirlwind), an American studies professor at the State University of Arizona, casts Lozen as a powerful and important leader, her role perhaps deliberately obscured to protect her life. From the 1840s through the 1870s, Lozen fought alongside Geronimo and her brother Victorio, participating in war councils, ambushes of Mexican soldiers, and territorial battles with American settlers and soldiers such as the Battle of Apache Pass, the massacre at Cibecue and countless other struggles. Though the book might have been better billed as historical fiction, Aleshire's informed speculation works well. But his decision to infuse his narrative voice with Native Americanisms--some derived from actual accounts, others apparently from the author's imagination--can seem presumptuous and hackneyed. Aleshire's subjects die from "the spotted disease," they move on course "like an arrow that has left the bow" and they go to "the Happy Place" when killed in battle. Perhaps Apache leaders did compare everything to hawks or deer or falling feathers. Although he tells us from the outset that he's writing this from an Apache viewpoint, in Aleshire's mouth the voice rings false. Only occasionally--as in his discussion of place names or of the complex politics of the Ghost Dances--does his thorough, substantive scholarship outweigh the thin conceit of his narrative voice. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>This Sporting Life</h2><p>When originally published this was described as an exceptional first novel because the characters are concerned with expressing themselves in physical rather than emotional or intellectual terms.

The closely observed characters are not particularly likeable or interesting. At least not as interpreted on this tape. Narrator Varla gives distinctive, memorable renderings of the large cast, though he makes none of them particularly sympathetic. He excels at animating scenes of violence and sensation but has less success with either the intellectual content or sarcasm. Nor does he convey any sense of the book&#39;s architecture. The listener receives a brutal, misanthropic political study of intermittent power and long stretches of tedium. Y.R.

Highlights include the inevitable coverage of <i>Easy Rider</i> ("Dennis Hopper is still insisting that he alone wrote the screenplay" and is suing Fonda for "millions and millions of dollars"); tales of growing up in Hollywood; and the fateful year of 1965 when Fonda's best friend shot himself, his father married for the fifth time, Jane married sleazy French filmmaker Roger Vadim, and he met and took acid with the Beatles. He also found time to write <i>Easy Rider</i>, hobnob with Mick Jagger and assorted luminary lounge lizards, and take in a Salvador Dali "happening" (what we now call "performance art"). Having now passed his fiftieth birthday, Fonda has come to terms with his seemingly distant father. He writes that something happened to Henry "that made him very quiet, very shy, and he let those qualities define his personality." Father and son, and Jane before she retired to her full-time role as Mrs. Ted Turner, all appeared in memorable films (for Peter's sake, who could forget classic trash like <i>The Wild Angels</i> and that hyperventilating cautionary tale, <i>The Trip</i>?). That kind of fame adds allure to an informative, enjoyable inside perspective on an acting family whose accumulated accomplishments rival those of the Barrymores. <i>Mike Tribby</i>The release of Fonda's autobiography is good timing. Currently riding the crest of his award-winning performance in Ulee's Gold, the author reminds us that he has run the gamut from fame to notoriety and back again. Lionized as the rebel loved by a generation in Easy Rider, Fonda morphed into the antiestablishment figure Hollywood loved to hate, an anachronism immersed in hippie hedonism. He milks the "little boy in his father's shadow" motif but candidly explores his relationship with the irascible Henry, sweetly reflects on his childhood years, recalls (doomed) encounters with authority figures, and thoughtfully considers domestic bliss. His account of the years spent jet-setting, careering about Europe in fancy cars, and sailing on the Tatoosh with cast and crew for various film projects is most riveting. A central theme: did Fonda behave the way he did because of or despite his ancestry?

Soon after, he moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where he and his brother Emanuel established a modest cotton brokering firm that would come to be called Lehman Brothers. <br><br> On September 15, 2008, Dick Fuld, the last CEO of Lehman Brothers, filed for corporate bankruptcy amid one of the worst financial crises in American history. After 164 years, one of the largest and most respected investment banks in the world was gone, leaving everyone wondering, "How could this have happened?" <br><br> Peter Chapman, an editor and writer for <i>The Financial Times</i>, answers this question by exploring the complete history of Lehman Brothers between those two historic Septembers. He takes us back to its early days as a cotton broker in Alabama, and then to its glory days as one of the leading corporate financiers in America. He also provides an intimate portrait of the people who ran Lehman over the decades-from Henry Lehman, the founder, to Bobbie Lehman, who led the company into the world of radio, motion pictures, and air travel in first part of the 20th century, to Dick Fuld, who allowed it to morph into a dealer of shoddy securities. <br><br> Throughout his account of this imperiously rich firm, Chapman examines the impact Lehman Brothers had not only on American finance but also on American life. As a major backer of companies like Pan American Airlines, Macy's, and RKO, Lehman helped lead the country into major new industries and helped support some of its most intrepid entrepreneurs. <br><br> He then shows how, starting in the 1980s, Lehman's increased focus on short-term gain investments led the firm down the dangerous path that would eventually lead to its demise. <br><br> In the end, the story of Lehman Brothers is not only the story of a truly important American company but a cautionary tale of what happens when leaders lose sight of their core mission in their quest for something too good to be true.</p><p>Peter Chapman has worked for the Financial Times since 1995 and is a former foreign correspondent for the BBC and the Guardian. He holds a master&#39;s degree n economics from the London School of Economics. He lives in London."...the historical parallels that the author provides are often thought- provoking and illuminating." <br> -<i>The New York Times</i> <br><br> "...a remarkable story of what Lehman once was and a somber story about what it became." <br> -FrumForum <br><br> "Chapman, financial reporter and editor, weaves a fascinating story framed in the history of the times during which Lehman Brothers helped shape financial markets." <br> -<i>Booklist</i> <br><br> "<i>The Last of the Imperious Rich</i> is an excellent, fast-paced account of the rise and fall of Lehman Brothers. Peter Chapman captures the firm's high and low moments with admirable clarity, especially the hubris that led to its ultimate demise. A valuable addition to Wall Street history." <br> -Charles Geisst, author of <i>Collateral Damaged</i> and <i>Wall Street: A History</i> <br><br> "<i>The Last of the Imperious Rich</i> is a gripping financial history. Peter Chapman has connected the dots from the unlikely beginnings of Henry Lehman in antebellum Alabama to the adventures of Bobbie Lehman on Wall Street to the domineering, and ultimately destructive, rule by Dick Fuld. Chapman's story is an object lesson in the dangers of aggressive short-term thinking in finance. Lehman's journey from helping companies like Campbell Soup to perpetrating modern financial schemes is a parable of how the markets went wrong." <br> -Frank Partnoy, George E.

Using that as a launching pad, he explores the reaches of modern physics, including theories on the origin of the universe (e.g., the Big Bang), the nature of black holes, and space-time. Finally, he poses the questions left unanswered by modern physics, especially how to combine all the partial theories into a &#x201c;unified theory of everything.&#x201d; &#x201c;If we find the answer to that,&#x201d; he claims, &#x201c;it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason.&#x201d;<br> <br> A great popularizer of science as well as a brilliant scientist, Hawking believes that advances in theoretical science should be &#x201c;understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists.&#x201d; In this book, he offers a fascinating voyage of discovery about the cosmos and our place in it.

Readers may not know who Anastasia is when they begin this book, but they will long remember her once they are finished. The cover of the handsomely conceived volume features a photograph of Anastasia, the last czar's youngest daughter, smiling slightly at her audience. Despite Anastasia's pearls and lace dress, readers will have no trouble identifying with her. Inside, they will find a design made to mimic a family photo album. The czar and his family were great photographers, and they spent many hours pasting pictures in their albums. Anastasia and her sisters added their own decorations of plants and flowers, which also appear here. The book moves in chronological order: there is Anastasia as a baby, then with her three older sisters and younger brother; as the clown of the family; on holiday; and later as a prisoner of the revolutionaries. Inset are color photos of imperial relics that have survived to become museum pieces: a doll, a gorgeous Fabergeegg, a toy cannon. The text, which features snippets of the writings of Anastasia and other Romanovs, sets Anastasia within her historical milieu and offers insight into both her character and her life. Young people who do not know the story of the Russian royal family may be shocked by its end; the book does not sensationalize the deaths, but the impact is powerful. The flap copy gives only a tantalizing bit of information about the author finding the imperial family's albums at the State Archives in Moscow and deciding that Anastasia's writings and photos would make a compelling book. How he went about compiling his materials would make an interesting story in its own right. <i>Ilene Cooper</i>The execution of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his family in 1918 has long been shrouded in mystery: ``For more than eighty years, the diaries, letters, and photo albums of the tsar's family were kept a secret.'' Now they are displayed in the State Archives in Moscow. Much of Brewster's book reproduces pictures from the photo album made by Anastasia, the youngest of the tsar's four daughters, and quotes many of her letters to her father and friends. It reveals not only Anastasia's daily life with her family but her wonderful sense of humor. The four daughters--Marie, Tatiana, Olga, and Anastasia--are shown posed (usually dressed identically) in lovely photographs; or riding bikes, swimming, sailing, walking in the snow, studying, painting, knitting. Many of the black-and-white photos were hand-colored by Anastasia. A particularly impish photo of the girls with their hats in their hands reveals their baldness after a bout of the measles. Although an epilogue discussing an impostor's claiming to be Anastasia detracts from the focus, this is a story of a close, happy family that does not foretell their violent end.

Thus was the First Crusade born. Its story is compelling, capable of inspiring awe through tales of bold adventure and revulsion through excesses of violence and barbarity, while at the same time providing us with significant insights into medieval society, morality and mentality. Tom Asbridge re-creates this fascinating period of history in a stunning narrative. Compelling and enlightening in equal measure, and drawing on new research which has radically remoulded our understanding of the movement, THE FIRST CRUSADE is a major work by an outstanding young historian.</p><p>Thomas Asbridge is a Reader in Medieval History at Queen Mary University in London, and an internationally renowned expert on the history of the Crusades. He has written and presented a major BBC TV series on the Crusades and a documentary on William Marshal. His acclaimed titles The First Crusade and The Crusades are also available from Simon &amp; Schuster.<br>"This lively account of the Crusade looks set to replace Steven Runciman's classic 1951 account of the expedition as the best introduction to the subject....Asbridge's book gives exactly the sort of fast-flowing narrative the story demands. He writes clearly and vigorously, with a fine eye for telling detail. Having walked considerable parts of the itinerary the Crusade followed, he presents a vivid picture of the landscapes they passed through. He admires the crusaders' hardiness and extraordinary boldness without condoning cruelties they inflicted....Recommended to a general reader who wants an introduction to the Crusades."--Hugh Kennedy, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Asbridge combines fast-paced history writing, evocative prose and lucid research for a first-rate history of the First Crusade....Brilliantly re-creates the three-year history of the First Crusade, chronicling its difficulties and victories, not downplaying its brutality but emphasizing its genuinely religious impulse."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Balances persuasive analysis with a flair for conveying with dramtic power the crusaders' plight throughout the nine-month siege of Antioch....Stunning...should revitalize the study of this fascinating period in European history."--Christopher Silvester, <em>The Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"Rousing....Asbridge knows this territory well. In 1999, he even walked 350 miles of the crusaders' route."--<em>Christian Science Monitor</em><p></p><br>"Asbridge, in keeping with his aim to produce a popular history, writes with maximum vividness."--Joan Acocella, <em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Asbridge has produced a taut, clear and exciting narrative, which also manages to convey the best of modern Crusader scholarship....His pace is tremendous, and he has a remarkable feel of place. It certainly helps that, like so many Crusaders nine centuries ago, Asbridge has himself walked 350 miles from Antioch towards Jerusalem."--<em>The Guardian</em><p></p><br>"Although well researched, the book wears its scholarship lightly and reads like a work of fiction, complete with vivid characters."--<em>The Herald</em> (Glasgow)<p></p><br>"Asbridge achieves vivid characterization and gripping storytelling without sacrifice of scholarship. Interweaving analysis, narrative, evocative description and occasional wry humor, he tells us--as no other book on the subject really does--who the crusaders were, how they behaved, how they killed and died and, most surprisingly of all, how they survived and triumphed."--Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto, author of <em>Millennium</em> and <em>Civilizations</em><p></p><br>"There is an underlying assumption among commentators looking at the confrontation between Islam and the West that it has been engendered by the events of September 11, 2001. Thomas Asbridge, by tracing the roots to the First Crusade in his lucid and provocative 'new history,' helps us to understand the present by explaining the past."--Akbar S. Ahmed, Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies American University<p></p><br></p><h2>Hard Eight (Stephanie Plum, No. 8)</h2><p>The #1 bestselling phenomenon continues in the eighth Stephanie Plum novel. The stakes get higher, the crimes get nastier, the chases get faster, and the men get hotter.<br><br>This time Stephanie, Morelli, Ranger. Lula, Valerie, and Grandma Mazur are strapped in for the ride of their lives. Stephanie is hired to find a missing child. But things aren't always as they seem and Stephanie must determine if she's working for the right side of the law. Plus, there's the Morelli question: can a Jersey girl keep her head on straight when more than just bullets are aimed for her heart? And with the Plum and Morelli relationship looking rocky, is it time for Ranger to move in for the kill? Janet Evanovich's latest thriller proves that <b>Hard Eight</b> will never be enough.</p><p>In <i>Hard Eight</i>, Stephanie Plum picks up a case a little nastier than anything the wisecracking bounty hunter's seen before. Evelyn Soder and her young daughter have gone on the run, leaving an angry ex-husband who's planning to collect on a child custody bond that will leave Evelyn's grandmother homeless. Stephanie's first clue that there's more to it than that comes in the form of Eddie Abruzzi, a shady local businessman who warns her to butt out of the case. Stephanie doesn't scare easily, but when Abruzzi's henchmen leave a bag of snakes on her doorknob and tarantulas in her car, she has no choice but to call Ranger, the hunky man of mystery whom she already owes too many favors. Steph knows that Ranger will soon be calling in his marker, but with her ex- fianc� Joe Morelli out of the picture, that should be OK--shouldn't it? In the meantime, she's got other fugitives to catch, aided by the usual band of misfits, plus a bumbling correspondence-school lawyer who's developed the hots for Stephanie's sister, Valerie. And Steph's in for a surprise from her mother, who proves she's not above wielding a dangerous weapon to save her daughter's life.<p> Author Janet Evanovich has made a bold move in using a soup�on of child jeopardy to pull this series out of the comfortable but formulaic pattern it was threatening to fall into. It's still funny, and yes, some cars are destroyed, but now there's a real edge of darkness under the humor.

But Evelyn's grandmother lives next door to Stephanie's parents, so Stephanie follows the trail left by Annie and Evelyn-and finds a lot more than she bargained for.</p><p><i>Hard Risk</i><br>Steven Soder is somehow linked with a very scary Eddie Abruzzi.

When he set out northward from Savannah with 60,000 veteran soldiers in January 1865, he was more convinced than ever that the bold application of his ideas of total war could speedily end the conflict. Before him lay South Carolina, the birthplace of secession. Beyond were North Carolina and Virginia, where Grant and Lee stood deadlocked.

Sherman himself, at the culmination of his military career, emerges here in an appealing portrait. His prewar sympathy for the South and its cause were in conflict with his love of the union and his theory of the least painful way of bringing the war to a conclusion. His unsuccessful attempt to offer the South a peace treaty that would restore the region to its prewar status is masterfully told and invokes a new and sympathetic understanding of the man.</p><h2>An Ordinary Man: An Autobiography</h2><p>A 2005 Civil Rights Freedom Award winner describes how he utilized his position as a hotel manager in violence-stricken Rwanda to offer shelter to more than twelve thousand members of the Tutsi clan and Hutu moderates, an act that inspired an Academy Award-nominated film. 60,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Paul Rusesabagina</b> was the first Rwandan manager of the Hotel Milles Collines, a European-owned luxury hotel in Rwanda.

I am a hotel manager. In April 1994, when a wave of mass murder broke out in my country, I was able to hide 1, 268 people inside the hotel where I worked.</p><p>When the militia and the Army came with orders to kill my guests, I took them into my office, treated them like friends, offered them beer and cognac, and then persuaded them to neglect their task that day. And when they came back, I poured more drinks and kept telling them they should leave in peace once again. It went on like this for seventy-six days. I was not particularly eloquent in these conversations. They were no different from the words I would have used in saner times to order a shipment of pillow-cases, for example, or tell the shuttle van driver to pick up a guest at the airport. I still don&#x2019;t understand why those men in the militias didn&#x2019;t just put a bullet in my head and execute every last person in the rooms upstairs but they didn&#x2019;t. None of the refugees in my hotel were killed. Nobody was beaten. Nobody was taken away and made to disappear. People were being hacked to death with machetes all over Rwanda, but that five-story building became a refuge for anyone who could make it to our doors. The hotel could offer only an illusion of safety, but for whatever reason, the illusion prevailed and I survived to tell the story, along with those I sheltered. There was nothing particularly heroic about it. My only pride in the matter is that I stayed at my post and continued to do my job as manager when all other aspects of decent life vanished. I kept the Hotel Mille Collines open, even as the nation descended into chaos and eight hundred thousand people were butchered by their friends, neighbors, and countrymen.</p><p>It happened because of racial hatred. Most of the people hiding in my hotel were Tutsis, descendants of what had once been the ruling class of Rwanda. The people who wanted to kill them were mostly Hutus, who were traditionally farmers. The usual stereotype is that Tutsis are tall and thin with delicate noses, and Hutus are short and stocky with wider noses, but most people in Rwanda fit neither description. This divide is mostly artificial, a leftover from history, but people take it very seriously, and the two groups have been living uneasily alongside each other for more than five hundred years.</p><p>You might say the divide also lives inside me. I am the son of a Hutu farmer and his Tutsi wife. My family cared not the least bit about this when I was growing up, but since bloodlines are passed through the father in Rwanda, I am technically a Hutu. I married a Tutsi woman, whom I love with a fierce passion, and we had a child of mixed descent together. This type of blended family is typical in Rwanda, even with our long history of racial prejudice. Very often we can&#x2019;t tell each other apart just by looking at one another. But the difference between Hutu and Tutsi means everything in Rwanda. In the late spring and early summer of 1994 it meant the difference between life and death.</p><p>Between April 6, when the plane of President Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down with a missile, and July 4, when the Tutsi rebel army captured the capital of Kigali, approximately eight hundred thousand Rwandans were slaughtered. This is a number that cannot be grasped with the rational mind. It is like trying&#x2014;all at once&#x2014;to understand that the earth is surrounded by billions of balls of gas just like our sun across a vast blackness. You cannot understand the magnitude. Just try! Eight hundred thousand lives snuffed out in one hundred days. That&#x2019;s eight thousand lives a day. More than five lives per minute. Each one of those lives was like a little world in itself. Some person who laughed and cried and ate and thought and felt and hurt just like any other person, just like you and me. A mother&#x2019;s child, every one irreplaceable.</p><p>And the way they died ...I can&#x2019;t bear to think about it for long. Many went slowly from slash wounds, watching their own blood gather in pools in the dirt, perhaps looking at their own severed limbs, oftentimes with the screams of their parents or their children or their husbands in their ears. Their bodies were cast aside like garbage, left to rot in the sun, shoveled into mass graves with bulldozers when it was all over. It was not the largest genocide in the history of the world, but it was the fastest and most efficient.</p><p>At the end, the best you can say is that my hotel saved about four hours&#x2019; worth of people. Take four hours away from one hundred days and you have an idea of just how little I was able to accomplish against the grand design.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What did I have to work with? I had a five-story building. I had a cooler full of drinks. I had a small stack of cash in the safe. And I had a working telephone and I had my tongue. It wasn&#x2019;t much. Anybody with a gun or a machete could have taken these things away from me quite easily. My disappearance&#x2014;and that of my family&#x2014;would have barely been noticed in the torrents of blood coursing through Rwanda in those months. Our bodies would have joined the thousands in the east-running rivers floating toward Lake Victoria, their skins turning white with water rot.</p><p>I wonder today what exactly it was that allowed me to stop the killing clock for four hours.</p><p>There were a few things in my favor, but they do not explain everything. I was a Hutu because my father was Hutu, and this gave me a certain amount of protection against immediate execution. But it was not only Tutsis who were slaughtered in the genocide; it was also the thousands of moderate Hutus who were suspected of sympathizing with or even helping the Tutsi &#x201c;cockroaches.&#x201d; I was certainly one of these cockroach-lovers. Under the standards of mad extremism at work then I was a prime candidate for a beheading.</p><p>Another surface advantage: I had control of a luxury hotel, which was one of the few places during the genocide that had the image of being protected by soldiers. But the important word in that sentence is image. In the opening days of the slaughter, the United Nations had left four unarmed soldiers staying at the hotel as guests. This was a symbolic gesture. I was also able to bargain for the service of five Kigali policemen. But I knew these men were like a wall of tissue paper standing between us and a flash flood.</p><p>I remembered all too well what had happened at a place called Official Technical School in a suburb called Kicukiro, where nearly two thousand terrified refugees had gathered because there was a small detachment of United Nations soldiers staying there. The refugees thought&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t blame them&#x2014;that the blue helmets of the UN would save them from the mobs and their machetes. But after all the foreign nationals at the school were put onto airplanes safely, the Belgians themselves left the country, leaving behind a huge crowd of refugees begging for protection, even begging to be shot in the head so they wouldn&#x2019;t have to face the machetes. The killing and dismemberment started just minutes later. It would have been better if the soldiers had never been there to offer the illusion of safety. Even the vaguest rumor of rescue had been fatal to those on the wrong side of the racial divide. They had clustered in one spot and made it easy for their executioners to find them. And I knew my hotel could become an abattoir just like that school.</p><p>Yet another of my advantages was a very strange one. I knew many of the architects of the genocide and had been friendly with them. It was, in a way, part of my job. I was the general manager of a hotel called the Diplomates, but I was eventually asked to take charge of a sister property, the nearby Hotel Mille Collines, where most of the events described in this book took place. The Mille Collines was the place in Kigali where the power classes of Rwanda came to meet Western businessmen and dignitaries. Before the killing started I had shared drinks with most of these men, served them complimentary plates of lobster, lit their cigarettes. I knew the names of their wives and their children. I had stored up a large bank of favors. I cashed them all in&#x2014;and then borrowed heavily&#x2014; during the genocide. My preexisting friendship with General Augustin Bizimungu in particular helped save the Mille Collines from being raided many times over. But alliances always shift, particularly in the chaos of war, and I knew my supply of liquor and favors would run dry in some crucial quarters. Before the hundred days were over a squad of soldiers was dispatched to kill me. I survived only after a desperate half hour during which I called in even more favors.</p><p>All these things helped me during the genocide. But they don&#x2019;t explain everything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me tell you what I think was the most important thing of all.</p><p>I will never forget walking out of my house the first day of the killings. There were people in the streets who I had known for seven years, neighbors of mine who had come over to our place for our regular Sunday cookouts. These people were wearing military uniforms that had been handed out by the militia. They were holding machetes and were trying to get inside the houses of those they knew to be Tutsi, those who had Tutsi relatives, or those who refused to go along with the murders.</p><p>There was one man in particular whom I will call Peter, though that is not his real name. He was a truck driver, about thirty years old, with a young wife. The best word I can use to describe him is an American word: cool. Peter was just a cool guy; so nice to children, very gentle, kind of a kidder, but never mean with his humor. I saw him that morning wearing a military uniform and holding a machete dripping in blood. Watching this happen in my own neighborhood was like looking up at a blue summer sky and seeing it suddenly turning to purple. The entire world had gone mad around me.</p><p>What had caused this to happen? Very simple: words.</p><p>The parents of these people had been told over and over again that they were uglier and stupider than the Tutsis. They were told they would never be as physically attractive or as capable of running the affairs of the country. It was a poisonous stream of rhetoric designed to reinforce the power of the elite. When the Hutus came to power they spoke evil words of their own, fanning the old resentments, exciting the hysterical dark places in the heart.</p><p>The words put out by radio station announcers were a major cause of the violence. There were explicit exhortations for ordinary citizens to break into the homes of their neighbors and kill them where they stood. Those commands that weren&#x2019;t direct were phrased in code language that everybody understood: &#x201c;Cut the tall trees. Clean your neighborhood. Do your duty.&#x201d; The names and addresses of targets were read over the air. If a person was able to run away his position and direction of travel were broadcast and the crowd followed the chase over the radio like a sports event.</p><p>The avalanche of words celebrating racial supremacy and encouraging people to do their duty created an alternate reality in Rwanda for those three months. It was an atmosphere where the insane was made to seem normal and disagreement with the mob was fatal.</p><p>Rwanda was a failure on so many levels. It started as a failure of the European colonists who exploited trivial differences for the sake of a divide-and-rule strategy. It was the failure of Africa to get beyond its ethnic divisions and form true coalition governments. It was a failure of Western democracies to step in and avert the catastrophe when abundant evidence was available. It was a failure of the United States for not calling a genocide by its right name. It was the failure of the United Nations to live up to its commitments as a peacemaking body.</p><p>All of these come down to a failure of words. And this is what I want to tell you: Words are the most effective weapons of death in man&#x2019;s arsenal. But they can also be powerful tools of life. They may be the only ones.</p><p>Today I am convinced that the only thing that saved those 1,268 people in my hotel was words. Not the liquor, not money, not the UN. Just ordinary words directed against the darkness. They are so important. I used words in many ways during the genocide&#x2014;to plead, intimidate, coax, cajole, and negotiate. I was slippery and evasive when I needed to be. I acted friendly toward despicable people. I put cartons of champagne into their car trunks. I flattered them shamelessly. I said whatever I thought it would take to keep the people in my hotel from being killed. I had no cause to advance, no ideology to promote beyond that one simple goal. Those words were my connection to a saner world, to life as it ought to be lived.</p><p>I am not a politician or a poet. I built my career on words that are plain and ordinary and concerned with everyday details. I am nothing more or less than a hotel manager, trained to negotiate contracts and charged to give shelter to those who need it. My job did not change in the genocide, even though I was thrust into a sea of fire. I only spoke the words that seemed normal and sane to me. I did what I believed to be the ordinary things that an ordinary man would do. I said no to outrageous actions the way I thought that anybody would, and it still mystifies me that so many ot...</p></p><h2>Ecology and Management of the North American Moose</h2><p>Once endangered but now estimated at one million, moose range in North America across a broad band of forest and glade, from Newfoundland to the Rocky Mountains, Alaska to Colorado. This abundantly illustrated volume explains moose biology and ecology and accesses the increasingly complex enterprise of managing the species. 33 color plates. 487 b&amp;w photos. 236 line illustrations.</p><p><b>Charles C. Schwartz</b> is leader of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team at the USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center in Bozeman, Montana. <b>Albert W. Franzmann</b>, a retired wildlife research veterinarian, was director of International Wildlife Veterinary Service, Inc.This massive book about the largest deer in the world is an impressive undertaking. Produced by the Washington-based Wildlife Management Institute, responsible in the past for excellent books on U.S. game species, the resulting volume is the most comprehensive ever published on moose. The editors' stated goals were that the book be readable and interesting, and they have succeeded with these expectations--it is fascinating. The opening chapter, "Of Moose and Man," alone holds one's interest so well that most people will end up reading instead of skimming this massive text. Other chapters cover moose evolution and taxonomy, behavior, reproduction and growth, predators, feeding, and hunting. The illustrations, 33 in color, are numerous and mostly excellent, consisting of photographs, drawings, historical paintings, graphs, and maps, all of which clarify the text as well as beautify it. The editors see the book as a "new and improved" informational base from which others can compare and contrast their work and have exceeded this understatement admirably. Although this work may be overkill for some libraries, for those with large natural history collections, it is highly recommended. <i>Nancy Bent</i></p><h2>Abstract Expressionism (Movements in Modern Art)</h2><p>In this incisive study, the curator and writer Debra Bricker Balken examines the work of the leading artists associated with Abstract Expressionism, including Willem de Kooning, Lee Krasner, Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko. At the same time she examines the myths surrounding the movement, the variation in the motivation and practice of artists grouped by art historians under the same heading, and the role played by critics in the movement's reception, both at the time and up to the present day.<br>Of equal value to the general reader and the art historical scholar alike, Balken's text is a valuable addition to the literature on one of the most influential of all twentieth-century art movements.</p><p>Debra Bricker Balken is an independent curator and writer specialising in modern and contemporary art.

Kennedy, Jr.</h2><p>For over twenty years Robert Littell was John F. Kennedy Jr.'s closest confidant. Now, in a beautiful and moving memoir, Littell introduces us to the private John. A story of laughter and sorrow, joy and heartbreak, <i>The Men We Became</i> is an unforgettable memoir. <br><br>Rob Littell was a freshman at Brown when he met the young JFK, Jr. during orientation week. Although Littell came from a privileged background, it was worlds apart from the glamorous life of the son of the late President and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Eager to be accepted on his own terms, Kennedy admired Littell's irreverence toward his celebrity and they became close friends. <br><br>John opened up to Littell on a very personal level, revealing the complex and sometimes tense nature of his relationships with his sister and cousins, as well as his mother's extraordinary influence on John - and how they both worked to keep it from being overbearing. John's marriage had its ups and downs and Carolyn had made enemies of some of his friends, but she was in great shape mentally and physically and they were planning to have children. <br><br>Littell recounts wonderful dinners at Jacqueline Onassis's apartment where she surprised him with his favorite dinner of specially burned hamburgers and weekends at her retreat in Martha's Vineyard where she critiqued their touch football while lying on a chaise lounge, her face covered in cold cream and cucumber slices. As students, Littell and Kennedy bummed around Europe. They slept in Hyde Park, sampled the pleasures of Amsterdam, ran afoul of customs officers and almost got busted at the Ritz Hotel for smoking pot. They even shared apartments in New York City until Jackie summoned them to dinner one day and gently suggested it was time to grow up. The two went on to pursue their professional lives. John trained as a lawyer - and Littell speaks of his friend's anguish at repeatedly failing the bar - and then he founded his own political magazine, which seemed only fitting because Kennedy yearned to live up to the family name and accepted that politics would be his destiny. Later on, Littell was a part of JFK, Jr.'s secret wedding to Carolyn Bessette on Cumberland Island, Georgia, and three years later a pallbearer at his funeral.<br><br>From shared adventures, private moments and lasting memories, Robert Littell offers a unique look at John F.

But when he reaches the village of Kallah and starts his apprenticeship, Baz learns that his master is very cruel. And when the master trades Baz to a magician for a sword, Baz expects no better from his new owner. But as Baz travels with this kind-hearted and wise magician, their journey takes him across the desert, up a mountain, and into the depths of life's meaning. He learns to re-examine his beliefs about people, the world, and himself, discovering that the whole world is connected and no person can ever be owned.</p></p><p><p>Kate Banks is the award-winning author of many books, including most recently <i>This Baby</i>.

He lives in Westchester County, New York.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>The promise had been made. Like any promise it sealed a commitment, but in a golden orb of hope and expectation. In the days that followed, the promise became a sort of roaming vision to Baz, a mysterious open door, imbued with the power to propel him into the future, to see himself as something more than he was. <br>The stranger had appeared, it seemed, from nowhere. He wandered into the village coupled with a horse whose dark satin coat he stroked rhythmically. Every so often he would whisper in the horse&#x2019;s ear. Then he would smile or laugh as though they were sharing a secret or a private joke. That made Baz wonder, with a touch of envy, if the stranger could speak the language of horses, or if the horse knew the stranger&#x2019;s tongue. <br>The stranger knew his destination. He didn&#x2019;t hesitate but went straight to the door of Baz&#x2019;s home, the last in a row of dwellings built of pale mud and stone. It was nearly sunset. The day was closing its large weary eye and the light was giving way to a sleepiness that made the stranger&#x2019;s presence even more commanding. His sudden appearance was a subtle reminder of the very enigma of existence. <br>Baz sat on a low wooden stool in the courtyard, a patch of pressed earth framed by smallish trees which, at this time of day, cast shadows much larger than they themselves. He was shelling nuts, separating the meats into a woven basket. The nuts had been drying for weeks now and it was time to open them, sample their ripe fruit. Tomorrow he would take them to the market to sell. He looked forward to that. The market seemed to Baz like the pulse of life with its colorful stalls where vendors sold dyed silks and cottons, dried fruits and beans, tea, spices, and clay pots baked in the sun to a brittle hardness. <br>In Baz&#x2019;s village, as in all places where each day appeared to be the same, etched in the shadow of the day before, strangers were a welcome intrusion, arousing curiosity, and sometimes suspicion. But strangers evoked something more: the notion that the village was connected to something much larger and more meaningful, giving significance to the small square of earth that defined it. <br>For several hours Baz had been shelling nuts, all of them much the same: the texture of their fine, thin skins, their meats, both hard and soft at once, the little knob that projected from their round fat bellies. His fingers had fallen into a repetitive motion, finding the weakness in the tough shells, applying pressure, then extracting the nut without breaking it. It was now summer, with hot, dry days that rolled into each other indistinguishably. Baz had often found himself wishing that something would happen to break the routine. He knew it was only a matter of time before the rain would come. It always had, and the earth, like himself, was a creature of habit. But as he sat shelling nuts, he longed for it to happen sooner, bringing weeks, months of wetness, changing the dress of the world. But he knew, too, that once the rain did come, it would soon become as monotonous as the heat had been. <br>Baz got to his feet and rested his eyes on the flowers in the garden, their bright colors rendered more intense by the sunset. He stared defiantly, willing their petals to fall, releasing that bottled-up energy, which, like his own, longed to escape. Then he lifted his eyes and fixed them on the figure walking toward him. <br>In the deepest recesses of his mind, Baz had been waiting for this moment. Now that it had come it was like the rain, bringing both relief and expectation. A few years back another man had ridden into the village. He had offered to take Baz&#x2019;s older brother and teach him a trade. A year later his second brother had left. Baz was the last, the third son. <br>&#x201c;Your turn will come,&#x201d; his mother had said as Baz watched his brothers depart with a mixture of sadness and envy at what could only be seen as opportunity. &#x201c;It is in the law of threes.&#x201d; The law of threes had dictated his very existence on this earth, his birth, his sex. And he suspected that his mother was right. It would dictate his parting someday. <br>His brothers had gone willingly, eager for change. <br>&#x201c;You will return when you&#x2019;ve learned all there is to know.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what the man who had taken his second brother had said. Baz had thought then that he might never see his brother again, certain that no one could glean all there was to know in a single lifetime. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The stranger left his horse in the shade of an ancient plane tree. He did not tether it but allowed it the freedom to roam. Then the stranger walked up the rough stone walkway that led to Baz&#x2019;s door. There was no need to knock. Baz&#x2019;s mother had seen the visitor and was there to greet him. She had never turned away a stranger. It was not her way, or that of her people. <br>&#x201c;I come from the west,&#x201d; said the stranger. &#x201c;I have been traveling since sunrise.&#x201d; He had come from the mountains where the land deepened in depth and color. &#x201c;I am moving toward the desert.&#x201d; The desert was where the land faded, becoming shallower with each step. <br>&#x201c;Please come in and have tea with us,&#x201d; said Baz&#x2019;s mother, opening the door ever wider. Baz bowed slightly before the man, his elder. Then his father appeared and took the stranger&#x2019;s hands, as was their custom. &#x201c;Welcome,&#x201d; he said. <br>The house smelled of dried spice, of tallow for soap and candles, of familiarity to Baz. He knew that the visitor would inhale this familiarity not with the same value or attachment that he did, but with an otherness, a newness. This made him sorry in a way. And as he tried to follow the stranger&#x2019;s gaze he saw his own surroundings differently, acutely aware of how perceptions were formed by habit. The rough woven cloth on the walls, the humble wooden objects his father had carved that lined the shelves, even the odor of nut oil rubbed into his skin, became foreign, strange, and otherly. <br>The white walls and beige tiled floor guarded the coolness of days, of time passed. But the fiery red cushions huddled comfortably around a low wooden table spoke of warmth and welcome. <br>The stranger seated himself across from Baz, folding his legs and placing his palms on his knees. Baz&#x2019;s mother brought the tea, a blend of jasmine and rose leaves, and a plate of sugary sweets. Then she took her place to the left of her son. <br>The visitor stroked a scarf wound loosely around his neck. His tunic with its wide bands of red, blue, and orange meant that he probably belonged to some tribe. Its loose weave and color made him look almost comical. He had come from afar. In Baz&#x2019;s village, they dressed in finely woven ivory, white, and beige, tones that reflected the sun. Only when the rains came did they don darker shades. <br>The stranger sipped his tea slowly, savoring each mouthful, rolling the hot liquid from one cheek to the other like a tiny ball. He picked delicately at the plate of sweets, playfully popping them into his mouth. <br>&#x201c;Ahh,&#x201d; he sighed, satisfied. Then his eyes settled on Baz&#x2019;s father, who was refilling the cups of tea and whose hands gave away his trade. He was a craftsman, a wood-carver, but he was slowly losing his sight and feared that he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to work much longer. The stranger&#x2019;s gaze moved into the distance, to the room at the end of the house where Baz&#x2019;s father turned his creations. His father knew that this was the work he had been born for, and he settled into it each day with quiet dignity. In that room he felt a oneness that linked him to his creations, and to all that was. But he knew, too, that this work was not for his sons. He was as sure of it as he was that the rising sun was bound to set. <br>The stranger did not introduce himself but got right to the point of his visit. &#x201c;I have come from Kallah, a weaving town,&#x201d; he said in a booming voice. &#x201c;Surely you have heard of it,&#x201d; he added, slowing his words, nearly whispering. He was like a bard telling a tale, imbuing each syllable, each phrase, with suspense. He waved his hands in the air, another gesture that told Baz that this man was from afar. The people in Baz&#x2019;s village were more subdued, discreet. Without thinking, Baz let his eyes fall on the man&#x2019;s hands, which now cradled the teacup. They were large, with long graceful fingers, but the nails were hard-looking, framed in a thin line of dirt that traced the edges of his fingertips. <br>Suddenly the stranger put down his teacup and reached across the table. &#x201c;So who have we here?&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Baz,&#x201d; said the boy. <br>The stranger held Baz&#x2019;s hands in his own like a treasure. &#x201c;There is always a need for young hands like these,&#x201d; he said. Then he tilted his head to one side. &#x201c;Somewhat soft,&#x201d; he said, smiling. His teeth were pearly white and his gums pink. &#x201c;But agile and nimble. Not the hands of a wood-carver, I&#x2019;m afraid, but the hands of a weaver, yes.&#x201d; <br>The stranger released Baz&#x2019;s hands, then reached for his tea. He was practiced in the art of persuasion and knew that he must allow time for his words to settle into the minds and hearts of his audience. He already knew the answer to what he was about to suggest, but he waited patiently, making the proposal in due time. <br>&#x201c;You, my boy, will be an apprentice to one of the greatest weavers in Kallah.&#x201d; He turned to Baz&#x2019;s mother and father. &#x201c;He will learn the trade in return for his keep. Then in some future time he will be free to continue, in a superior role.&#x201d; The stranger paused. &#x201c;Or return home,&#x201d; he said carelessly, the tone of his voice suggesting that Baz would never do that. The stranger turned to Baz. &#x201c;As he wishes.&#x201d; Then he distanced himself, his eyes following the rays of light that had burst through the window, creating a pattern of dancing stripes across the floor. <br>&#x201c;Do you wish to go, son?&#x201d; Baz&#x2019;s father asked. <br>Baz did not have to think or reflect. He knew the answer as well as he knew his name. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said. <br>So the promise was made, and sealed in a show of clasped hands, his mother&#x2019;s small and soft, his father&#x2019;s square and rough, Baz&#x2019;s own long and nimble, and those of the stranger tinged with dirt. <br>&#x201c;I will continue my journey,&#x201d; said the stranger, getting to his feet. &#x201c;But I will return before the new moon.&#x201d; <br>Baz led the stranger out to where his horse was waiting next to the plane tree. &#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&#x201c;I do not have one name,&#x201d; said the stranger, frowning. &#x201c;People call me many things. What would you call me?&#x201d; <br>Baz did not have to think long. &#x201c;You are the Man Who Loves His Horse,&#x201d; he said. <br>This made the stranger smile. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Baz reviewed his life, all sixteen years of it, with the sweet nostalgia that always comes before a parting. A film of dust settled like a pastel haze, covering any unpleasantness. He thought of the departure of his two brothers who had yet to return. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back,&#x201d; he said to his mother. He repeated these same words many times to himself as if the repetition of the phrase would ensure its coming to pass. <br>&#x201c;Of course you will,&#x201d; said his mother, hanging the washed clothes in the sun to dry. They were worn to a comfort much like Baz&#x2019;s own life. <br>In his mother&#x2019;s gaze Baz saw the soul of a woman who was seeing her child for the last time. Despite that, Baz did not think for a moment that he wouldn&#x2019;t go, nor did his parents, who shared the knowledge that they were doing what was right. They knew not where this came from. They could barely describe it beyond the feeling that sometimes in life certain things were meant to be. And this was one of them. <br>&#x201c;Maybe the stranger won&#x2019;t return,&#x201d; said Baz&#x2019;s mother with a half smile. <br>Baz breathed in her scent, a mixture of smells coupled with sounds. In the corner sat an instrument that she played, some strings attached to a wooden frame. Baz had no idea where it had come from, only that it was something she&#x2019;d always had, one of those things with no discernible origins, no real beginnings. It was simply there, a part of her. <br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; said Baz, smiling back at her, attempting to build suspense into an event that had none because they all knew the truth. The stranger would return. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>As Baz prepared for bed he lit a candle and watched the flame begin to flicker, mirroring the agitation he felt inside. He tried to stop it with his eyes, but it jumped even higher until he gave up. <br>He drifted into sleep, dreaming of water. A man appeared who wished to buy him. The man was smiling. But then the water rose, engulfing the image. And the night that had seemed so long when it lay ahead was suddenly over. The following days flew, too, until it seemed there were mere minutes between one moon and the next. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Text copyright � 2012 by Kate Banks <br>Illustrations copyright � 2012 by Peter S�s <br></p><h2>Mary Poppins Comes Back</h2><p>Pulled down from the clouds at the end of a kite string, Mary Poppins is back.

Think not forever of yourselves, O chiefs, nor of your own generation. Think of continuing generations of our families, think of our grandchildren and of those yet unborn, whose faces are coming from beneath the ground". (Deganawidah)<p>Paul Wallace retells the orally transmitted epic of Deganawidah, the Peacemaker, the charismatic spiritual leader who, over 500 years ago, brought warring tribes of the Northeast together to form the Iroquois Confederacy. The Peacemaker's work is preserved in the Confederacy's traditional constitution, which had a largely unacknowledged impact in shaping the American Bill of Rights and the U.S. Constitution. The Confederacy remains united under the Peacemaker's unbroken lineage, today represented by the Tadodaho (chief), the temporal and spiritual leader of the Six Nations. In his epilogue, John Mohawk chronicles the Confederacy's struggles to preserve its lands and sovereign dignity since the 18th century. The teachings of the Peacemaker remain vital today, offering an inspired model for consensus-building among nations and peoples throughout the world.</p></p><p></p><h2>Poison Plate (Vortex Books)</h2><p>When Mark first becomes the foster child of restaurant owners, he thinks they just want free help, but when he is wrongfully accused of trying to sabotage the business, he is determined to find the true culprit.</p><p>Michele Sobel Spirn started writing when she was sixteen.

The darkness that has haunted him for most of his life has returned. A murderer lurks in the shadows around Browser&#39;s village, taking people one at a time. Browser turns for help to a crazy tribal elder who solved many crimes before. Browser is certain old Stone Ghost knows the killer. But the elder is telling no one. As the war chief frantically works to find the fiend, the murderer watches far closer than Browser would ever dream possible. Only a few heartbeats ahead in geologic time, archaeologist William &#34;Dusty&#34; Stewart finds himself excavating a mass grave in New Mexico filled with the brutalised bodies of children. As the number of bodies begins to mount, he is forced to call upon the skills of his arch-nemesis: world-renowned Canadian physical anthropologist Dr Maureen Cole. What Dusty and Maureen discover about the killer&#39;s method is almost too horrible to believe.</p><p>Book two in the Anasazi Mysteries series, <i>The Summoning God</i> is the sequel to <i>The Visitant</i>, in which archaeologist-authors Kathleen O'Neal Gear and W. Michael Gear introduced readers to murder, mayhem, and the myriad details of life in a 13th-century Native American pueblo. In both novels, the narrative arcs between the present and the past, drawing aside the seemingly thin veil of time that separates them. Here, as archaeologists Dusty Stewart and Maureen Cole sift through an ancient Anasazi kiva, attempting to understand the circumstances that could have led to the presence of 33 charred children's bodies in the ceremonial chamber, we also see the members of the pueblo as they move toward the terrible destruction so carefully unearthed by Stewart and Cole. This narrative device isn't revolutionary, but it <i>is</i> clever: the demands of classic mystery plotting (we have a corpse, but who committed the crime?) are fulfilled, while the reader lives simultaneously in the worlds of evidence creation and deduction.<p> The Anasazi characters will be familiar to readers of <i>The Visitant</i>: warriors Browser and Catkin, holy men Springbank and Stone Ghost, and the witch Two Hearts continue to move silently through the sand and sagebrush, circling through a world marked by warring religions and vanishing resources. When Browser and Catkin find a mutilated old woman surrounded by the skulls of her clan, they must summon all their courage to combat what surely must be witchcraft--or is it? Although the narrative founders at times in a sea of murkily presented myth, the characters are vibrantly drawn (though to watch an Anasazi holy man conduct an autopsy in a manner that would do Kay Scarpetta proud is one of several discordant anachronisms).</p><p> <i>The Summoning God</i>, like its predecessor, renders the lives and habits of the Anasazi in compelling detail: we learn that they used blazing star petals for perfume and that their ceremonial purification rites included cornmeal and ground seashells. Though the tenacity with which the authors seek to hammer home a situational equivalency between modern life and the 13th century is sometimes painfully heavy-handed, the evocation of daily life never is. Readers might wish to acknowledge that overutilization of resources, a thirst for territory, and a propensity toward holy wars are indeed threads that bind us to the Anasazi--then ignore the lectures and settle into the story. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Trigun Anime Manga Volume 2: Wolfwood</h2><p>On this desert planet of chaos, corruption, and heat, few people can afford to be generous, non-violent, and kind.

Learn more at CarlaNeggers.com.A s much as Heather Sloan loved a bright New England winter day, chasing a puppy through knee-deep snow in seventeen degrees wasn't her idea of fun. Rohan&#x2014;the runaway puppy, a twelve-week-old golden retriever&#x2014;wasn't quickly tiring of his romp or sticking to the plowed driveway and shoveled walks, either. Not a chance. She spotted his tracks, leading through the woods straight for quiet, frozen Echo Lake.<br><br>She wasn't following a rabbit or deer by mistake. They definitely were puppy tracks. She paused, noting that the trail veered to the right, parallel to the lake. Something must have caught Rohan's attention. A bird, a breeze, a noise.<br><br><em>Great.</em><br><br>Heather followed the tracks through a deeper drift, but they disappeared under the low-hanging, snow-laden branches of two gnarly hemlocks. Rohan could easily fit under them. She couldn't. The trees grew so close together that trying to squeeze between them meant getting snow down her back. Going around them would risk a delay in finding the tracks again.<br><br>She was already cold. She wasn't dressed for a puppy rescue. Ankle boots, leather gloves, a wool scarf and her three-quarter-length chocolate-brown wool coat. <em>Why?</em> Of all days, why hadn't she worn her Car-hartt jacket and L.L. Bean boots? It wasn't as if her attire would impress Vic Scarlatti, the newly retired diplomat whose renovations she was overseeing. His 1912 lake house was out of sight now, up through the trees past a small guesthouse. He was searching the garage, shed and porches. Adrienne Portale, the wine-expert daughter of one of Vic's Foreign Service friends, was searching the house, in case Rohan hadn't slipped outside, after all.<br><br>But he had, and he would be in serious trouble in this cold if Heather didn't get to him soon. What was a little snow down her back? With five older brothers, it wasn't anything she wasn't used to. They'd had an epic snowball fight on New Year's Day.<br><br>She plunged between the hemlocks, moving as fast as she could, but there was no way to avoid disturbing the snow clinging to the evergreen branches. She got a spray in her face and a clump down her back and almost lost a boot, but when she emerged on the other side of the hemlocks, she was practically standing in Rohan's tracks.<br><br>She went still, quieting her breathing as she listened. Her cheeks were numb, and her fingertips and toes ached with the cold. She'd pulled her scarf over her head as best she could in lieu of a hat, but it was loose now, one end dangling down her front. The late-January afternoon sky was cloudless, the air as crisp and clear and cold as it had been since the latest storm earlier in the week. She glanced to her left toward the snow-covered lake. Echo Lake wasn't big, but it was one of the largest lakes in out-of-the-way Knights Bridge, Massachusetts.<br><br><em>There.</em><br><br>Heather spun around at a sound up ahead and forced herself not to move. She listened, positive she heard something besides her own breathing.<br><br>Yips.<br><br>A high-pitched, mournful cry. It had to be Rohan.<br><br>With a mix of worry and relief, she surged in the direction of the distressed yips and cries, following the tracks through bare-limbed maples and oaks and past white pines. The ground was uneven, the snow sometimes drifting up past her knees. Snowshoes or back-country skis would have helped, but she had left hers in her truck and Vic wasn't much on winter sports. "I like looking at the snow," he'd told her. "I don't necessarily like going out in it for fun."<br><br>She came to a shallow, rocky brook that emptied into the lake but now was mostly frozen. Water trickled and swirled in a few spots among the snow and ice where the current was stronger.<br><br>"Rohan," Heather called softly, not wanting to startle him by yelling. "Where are you, buddy?"<br><br>She heard panting then a whimper. She eased closer to the edge of the brook and peered upstream. Her heart jumped when she saw a golden ball of fur&#x2014;little Rohan, struggling to climb out from the midst of the water, snow, ice and rocks.<br><br>"Oh, Rohan. You are in a mess, aren't you?"<br><br>Trees crowded the bank, and it was steeper up where Rohan was stuck. Getting to him wasn't going to be easy. Staying close to the brook, she grabbed hold of saplings and branches, using them to help her keep her balance in the difficult conditions.<br><br>Once she was parallel to Rohan, he let out an eager, full-fledged bark.<br><br>He must have frolicked his way out here, got stuck in the ice and snow and had run out of steam. He was, after all, only a puppy. Heather could see there was no way he could get out of his predicament with just a bit of encouragement from her. She would have to grab him&#x2014;preferably without ending up trapped in the cold brook herself.<br><br>"Easy, Rohan," she said, holding on to a thin tree and reaching with her free hand to the shivering puppy. "Let's get you warm and safe, okay?"<br><br>She stretched, her fingertips within inches of him, but she slipped in the snow. She couldn't regain her footing and went down on one knee, planting her free hand in the snow to keep herself from falling in the brook. She felt cold water flowing into her left boot and up her lower leg but bit back a yell lest she panic Rohan. She finally righted herself, losing her glove in the process.<br><br>She didn't hesitate. She scooped up the puppy and moved quickly, launching past the tree she was using for balance then sinking against another one. She anchored her feet in the snow to prevent her and Rohan from skidding back into the brook.<br><br>She cuddled the furry dog against her. She could feel his little heart racing. "I've got you," she whispered, her own heart thumping madly. "I've got you."<br><br>She wanted to sit in the snow and catch her breath, but she knew that wasn't wise. Her shivering was a warning she was in danger of hypothermia. It would be a cold, wet trek back to Vic's house, so she had to get on with it and keep moving.<br><br>As she stood straight, she thought she smelled wood smoke&#x2014;from a fireplace or a woodstove, perhaps. How was that possible? She was too far from the main house. It had to be her imagination or her natural optimism at work.<br><br>She heard the snap of a twig and looked up through the trees behind her, away from the brook. A man she didn't recognize stepped comfortably down to her and Rohan. He wore a black suede jacket and solid boots but no hat or gloves.<br><br>He scanned her from head to toe before he spoke. "Nice job with the puppy rescue."<br><br>"You watched?"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am. I didn't want to startle you."<br><br>Heather felt Rohan stir in her arms, but he didn't bark. Probably too tired. "Ready to come to my rescue if I fell in, were you?"<br><br>"You did fall in," he said, pointing to her wet lower left leg.<br><br>"Not all the way in."<br><br>"You'd be a popsicle if you fell all the way in. I was on my way to rescue the little guy myself. I'm staying at Vic's guesthouse. I got in late last night. My name's Brody, by the way."<br><br>"Heather Sloan," she said. "Good to meet you."<br><br>Except she felt as if she should know him. <em>Did</em> know him.<br><br>He narrowed his eyes&#x2014;dark, flecked with gold&#x2014;on her. He had short-cropped dark hair, a square jaw, a cleft chin. She shook off the idea that he was familiar somehow. She didn't know anyone who would be a guest of Vic Scarlatti.<br><br>He stepped past her and picked up her fallen glove out of the snow. She took in his broad shoulders and his dark canvas pants covering muscular thighs. He looked strong and incredibly fit. Another diplomat? Somehow Heather didn't think so.<br><br>He stood straight and tucked her glove into her jacket pocket. "It's filled with snow. It's not going to keep you warm. I can take the pup if you'd like. Give you a chance to pull yourself together."<br><br>"I'm fine, thanks, and I can handle Rohan."<br><br>"Rohan?" Brody stroked the soft fur behind the puppy's ear. "He doesn't look much like a rider of Rohan at the moment, does he?"<br><br>Heather agreed the Tolkien-inspired name was in-congruently regal for such a rambunctious, cute-as-the-devil puppy. He was getting heavy in her arms, but she noticed his heart rate had settled down.<br><br>"He's not my puppy," she said. "I just helped look for him."<br><br>"Vic Scarlatti has a puppy?" Brody grinned as if the prospect both amused and surprised him. "I guess retirement will do that even to a guy like Vic."<br><br>"He's a stray. Rohan, I mean. Vic found him wandering around alone out here a few days ago and took him in."<br><br>"Well, good for Vic."<br><br>"Another guest named him Rohan. Adrienne Portale. Are you two friends?"<br><br>"Nope. Don't know her."<br><br>Rohan snuggled deeper into Heather's arms. "I should get back. It's cold even for January."<br><br>"I'll walk with you."<br><br>She sucked in a breath. When it came right down to it, she had no idea who this man was. "Thanks, but I can manage."<br><br>"Mind if I walk with you as far as the guesthouse?"<br><br>"How do you know Vic?"<br><br>"We go back a ways."<br><br>A vague answer. "You're a lot younger than he is."<br><br>"Yes, I am."<br><br>Heather hesitated. "I should let Vic know that Rohan is safe."<br><br>"I already texted him that a dark-haired woman in a brown coat had just rescued a puppy from the brook."<br><br>"That was efficient."<br><br>"He hasn't responded. I also told him you could use some dry clothes." Brody nodded up through the woods toward the main house. "Shall we?"<br><br>Heather could feel Rohan settling into her arms. He wasn't a light puppy. She needed to get moving if she was going to carry him all the way back to the house.<br><br>She took a step up the hill. "I guess if you're one of Vic's friends, it's safe to go off with you. You're not going to bonk me on the head and dump me in the guesthouse cellar. It doesn't have a cellar, for one thing."<br><br>"That's a dramatic imagination you have there."<br><br>"It's not drama. It's being practical. I'm very practical."<br><br>"Do you say everything you think?"<br><br>"No. Do you?"<br><br>His gaze slid over her. He smiled. "No." Despite the frigid temperature, she felt heat in her cheeks. Maybe she <em>should</em> think before she spoke. She adjusted Rohan in her arms again as she took another step up the hill. "I'm also good at taking care of myself."<br><br>"Come on. You pushed hard through the snow, and you're frozen. Let me take Rohan."<br><br>Heather didn't protest when Brody scooped up the half-asleep puppy. She tried not to shiver or let her teeth chatter, but with the cold weather and her partial dip in the icy brook, she had to admit she was frozen. "I didn't expect Rohan to end up down here by the lake."<br><br>"He bolted past the guesthouse. I saw him out the window but couldn't get out fast enough to grab him before he hit the brook. You're okay to walk, aren't you?"<br><br>"Yep. No problem."<br><br>"Didn't think it would be. Tough as nails, right?"<br><br>"Just used to New England winters."<br><br>"Sure thing."<br><br>There was something in his tone Heather couldn't quite place. Familiarity? Sarcasm? Amusement? A mix of all three? She couldn't deny she was madly curious about him, but maybe he just had funny ideas about Knights Bridge and the people who lived there.<br><br>She resisted asking him the four thousand questions she had. She needed to get Rohan back to Vic's. With her wet pants and case of the shivers, she ought to get dry and warm herself She was happy to let Brody lead the way back to Vic's house, thus allowing her to step in his footprints instead of in virgin snow. It was much less tiring, and the snow didn't seem to faze him.<br><br>"How do you like Knights Bridge so far?"<br><br>He glanced back at her. "Do you really want to ask me that right now?"<br><br>"Seventeen degrees, snow, ice, a golden retriever puppy on the loose?" Heather grinned at him. "What's not to like?"<br><br>"Oh, yeah, Heather Sloan." Just the faintest of smiles. "What's not to like?"<br><br>Vic Scarlatti bought his house on Echo Lake twenty years ago, when he was a rising star in the US diplomatic corps, and had done virtually nothing to it since. That suited Heather. The previous owner, the granddaughter of the Boston financier who'd built the house, had updated the plumbing, wiring and heat about ten years before the property went on the market upon her death. It was classic Arts and Crafts, oriented to take in the best views of its long-neglected garden and the lake.<br><br>Brody showed no sign of appreciating the house's charms and potential as he set Rohan on his puppy bed in the small, cluttered mudroom off the kitchen. The little golden retriever immediately gave a deep sigh and rolled onto his side, dozing.<br><br>"The bed looks new," Brody said.<br><br>"It is," Heather said, walking past him through the open doorway into the kitchen. "I bought it at the country store in town. I figured Rohan needed a bed."<br><br>"Does Vic plan to keep him?"<br><br>"He says absolutely not."<br><br>She sank onto a chair at the kitchen table. She was stiffer than she wanted to admit after her adventure, but at least she was warming up fast. She pulled off her ankle boots. Both socks were wet, but her left one was sopping. Another of her out-into-the-cold sins was her choice of thin cotton socks. She peeled them off and stuffed them in her boots. She'd figure out what to do about them later, when she didn't have Brody for an audience.<br><br>He grabbed Rohan's water bowl and filled it at the deep porcelain kitchen sink, one of the granddaughter's additions. He brought the bowl to Rohan and set it close to his bed. The puppy stirred. At first he was too lethargic to care about anything except yawning, but he managed to get onto all fours and lap at the water.<br><br>"You should have some water, too," Brody said as he rejoined Heather in the kitchen. "It's easy to get dehydrated in this dry cold and not realize it."<br><br>"Water would be nice."<br><br>Before she could stand, he had a cupboard open and a glass in hand. He filled it with water and set it on the table in front of her. "Drink up."<br><br>"You remind me of my brothers. They never look cold, either. You don't even have a red nose. I do, don't I?"<br><br>"You were out in the cold longer than I was."<br><br>"A diplomatic answer. My brothers won't go easy on me for almost freezing to death while chasing a puppy."<br><br>"What would they have had you do?"<br><br>"Not take chances. Wear wool socks, at least." She smiled suddenly. "But all's well that ends well, right?"<br><br>"And you don't have to tell your brothers."<br><br>"True, but it's too good a story not to tell. I wish I'd spotted your footprints instead of Rohan's, though. I'd have let you do the rescuing."<br><br>Brody unbuttoned his jacket but didn't take it off. He had on a dark sweater over his taut abdomen. Heather was accustomed to fit guys, and he was obviously and decidedly fit. She averted her gaze and drank her water. She was noticing too much about this man. Maybe dehydration and adrenaline had put her senses on overdrive.<br><br>"Do you have dry clothes here?" he asked.<br><br>"Why would I?" She snapped up straight, almost knocking her water glass off the table. "Wait. You don't think&#x2014;" She gulped in a breath. "I'm almost forty years younger than Vic. No. Absolutely not."<br><br>Brody grinned, his dark eyes sparking with humor. "That's not what I was thinking. I was just wondering if you kept a change of clothes here given your work. You and Vic Scarlatti? Damn, that's funny. Seriously funny."<br><br>"What do you mean, <em>seriously funny?</em> You say that as if I'm not. " She stopped herself, abandoning that train of thought in the nick of time. "Never mind."<br><br>"As if you're not attractive, you mean? That's not what I'm saying." He paused, warmth replaci...</p><h2>Deva Bhumi: The Abode of the Gods in India</h2><p>&#34;When I had my first darshan with my Guru, Neem Karoli Baba (Maharajji), K.K. Sah was my translator-the first person I met from Maharajji&#39;s family of devotees. When Maharajji had K.K. take me into his home, he also had him take me into his heart. K.K. became my brother. I truly felt the bond beyond this lifetime with K.K., something I had never before felt. He was never impressed with my western credentials. Instead, we had unconditional love. Deva Bhumi, this book from K.K. Sah, is a gift from the immense heart of the region in northern India known as the Kumaon. It&#39;s K.K.&#39;s story of growing up in the lap of the siddhas. Above all, this book is permeated with the highest spiritual emotion, or bhav as it&#39;s called in India, that leaves us with the feeling of unconditional love and the possibility for our own realization of true kindness and compassion.&#34; - Ram Dass</p><p></p><h2>Pat the Pet (Pat the Bunny) (Lift-the-Flap)</h2><p><b>Play peek-a-boo with Pat the Bunny and friends!&nbsp;</b><br><br><i>Pat the Bunny</i> has been a beloved American classic for over 75 years.

The editors seek to integrate broader research into the urban policy discussion by bringing urban studies scholars together with economists and researchers studying subjects with important urban implications. The six papers in this inaugural volume are divided into two sections. The first three assess the state of urban research and policy. The others address important aspects of the urban economy: education, racial segregation, and federal housing policies.</p><p>When first published in 1979, four years after the end of one of the most<br>divisive conflicts in the United States, <i>The Irony of Vietnam</i> raised eyebrows. Most critics argued that the country had ?stumbled into a quagmire in Vietnam through hubris and miscalculation,&#x201d; as the <i>New York Times</i> put it. But Leslie H. Gelb and Richard K. Betts, who had reviewed recently declassified White House and Defense Department documents, maintained that policymakers in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations had their eyes open, had based decisions on a thorough knowledge of what was possible on the ground, and knew the cost of action and inaction. Explains Fareed Zakaria in his foreword, those prosecuting the war chose ?middle-of-the-road solutions,&#x201d; for a variety of what seemed reasonable assumptions. The overall tenor of the era that shaped foreign policy?the belief in the domino theory and a strident anti-communism?restricted policymakers&#x2019; thinking and prevented a more flexible approach, however. And thereby lies a lesson for today's policymakers<br><p><br><b>Leslie H.

President of the Heritage Rose Foundation and a member of the American Rose Society, he is a judge for the international rose trials in Europe and the United States. Scanniello has written three books on roses, including &#34;A Year of Roses&#34;, recipient of the American Horticultural Society&#39;s Annual Book Award. He lives and gardens in New Jersey.One of the country's foremost authorities on roses, Scanniello is the often-quoted rosarian responsible for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's lovely Cranford rose garden. Imbued with a delightfully intimate tone, Scanniello's practical new guide seems the next best thing to sitting down with him for a cup of tea and chatting about the very best ways to deal with roses of all types--modern or antique. Addressing different methods for various areas of the country, Scanniello touches on topics ranging from ordering roses by mail order to pruning, planting, fertilizing, and nonchemical ways to keep rosebushes healthy. Always an enthusiastic instructor, Scanniello offers accessible counsel for beginning gardeners and fascinating tips for gardeners who might already possess expertise but could readily use advice from an expert. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Russia and the Arts: The Age of Tolstoy and Tchaikovsky</h2><p><i>Russia and the Arts: The Age of Tolstoy and Tchaikovsky</i> explores the history of Russian portraiture between 1867 and 1914, a time of great cultural vibrancy in the country and a golden age of the Russian portrait. While Tolstoy and Dostoevsky were publishing masterpieces such as <i>Anna Karenina</i> and <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> and Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov were taking Russian music to new heights, Russian art was developing a new self-confidence. The penetrating Realism of the 1870s and 1880s was later complemented by the brighter hues of Russian Impressionism and the bold forms of Symbolist painting; these styles were applied to portraits of prominent thinkers, writers, scientists, artists, actors, composers and musicians by the most outstanding painters of the day. This volume traces the period&#x2019;s developments in Russian art through the collection of the Moscow State Tretyakov Gallery, founded in 1856, itself a product of this same moment of cultural flourishing. Portraiture was a major part of the collection&#x2019;s mission from the late 1860s, when founder Pavel Tretyakov began to commission and acquire portraits guided by two principal values: the historical role of the sitter and the artistic value of the portrait. Beautifully illustrated with key works from the State Tretyakov Gallery, <i>Russia and the Arts</i> highlights some of the extraordinary developments that took place in the arts in Russia in the years before World War I.</p><p>Provides not only a vivid and intimate survey of an extraordinary period, but a kind of advert for the virtues of the painted portrait itself.

Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2010</strong> As the finale to Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, <i>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest </i>is not content to merely match the adrenaline-charged pace that made international bestsellers out of <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> and <em>The Girl Who Played with Fire</em>. Instead, it roars with an explosive storyline that blows the doors off the series and announces that the very best has been saved for last. A familiar evil lies in wait for Lisbeth Salander, but this time, she must do more than confront the miscreants of her past; she must destroy them. Much to her chagrin, survival requires her to place a great deal of faith in journalist Mikael Blomkvist and trust his judgment when the stakes are highest. To reveal more of the plot would be criminal, as Larsson's mastery of the unexpected is why millions have fallen hard for his work. But rest assured that the odds are again stacked, the challenges personal, and the action fraught with neck-snapping revelations in this snarling conclusion to a thrilling triad. This closing chapter to The Girl's pursuit of justice is guaranteed to leave readers both satisfied and saddened once the final page has been turned. <em>--Dave Callanan</em>Stieg Larsson was the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine Expo. He was a leading expert on anti-democratic, right-wing extremist organisations. He died in 2004, soon after delivering the text of the novels that make up the Millennium Trilogy.</p><h2>The Comic Book Heroes: The First History of Modern Comic Books - From the Silver Age to the Present</h2><p><b><i>The Comic Book Heroes</i></b> begins with that first issue of the Flash, an event that would alter American pop culture forever.

Reinterpreting the Gospel was particularly compelling for Matthew&#39;s church because his Christians lived in a time of profound transition. The Passion of Jesus, then, was not simply a story of suffering out of the past but a point of identification for the Christians of Matthew&#39;s own time.For us twentieth-century Christians, who also know the peculiar suffering and hope of living in an age that is both dying and being born, the Passion of Jesus according to Matthew has special meaning.</p><p>The passion is the climactic event in each of the gospels. These volumes elucidate the passion in its historical background and explore its theological breadth and depth.Donald Senior, CP, is professor of New Testament at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.

She had dragged me out of bed that morning to talk about her most recent relationship, which, like many before, was headed downhill fast. Before I could even order a cup of coffee, she declared that her latest would-be-boyfriend, Gavin, was an asshole. She then proceeded to give me the play-by-play of their relationship with her usual enthusiasm.<br><br>'He never calls when he says he will. He acts like he likes me one minute, but then I don't hear from him for days. I am just so fed up with men and their games!' <br>I listened, as good friends do, as Adison vented her �frustrations. She rambled on about Gavin's commitment phobia; how his hot and cold behavior drove her up the wall; and how the next time she saw him, she was going to give him a piece of her mind. But somewhere between the words jerk and player, I realized that this most recent relationship disaster sounded a lot like her last one. In fact, when I thought about it, it seemed like getting dumped was becoming a pattern <br>for her.<br><br>As Adison was about to call this guy an asshole for the tenth time, it hit me: maybe it wasn't such a coincidence that all the guys she dated turned out to be jerks. Maybe there was an actual reason for it. It did seem a little odd that all the guys she liked drove her crazy and eventually ended up MIA, especially since each relationship started out so differently. Yet somehow she kept getting the same result. I realized I knew what was happening. There was only one common denominator in all of Adison's relationships, and it wasn't the men<br>'Adison,' I said. 'Do you ever think maybe it's not him, it's you?'<br>Adison's jaw dropped. As soon as the words left my mouth, I cringed and waited for her reaction. I was supposed to be her friend. I was supposed to be on her side. I was supposed to call this guy a selfish bastard, not bruise her already damaged ego. In fact, I was just about to recant my statement when she said, 'Really? You think I'm making him act this way?'<br><br>Up until that moment I truly believed that Adison and I had just been picking the wrong guys. Whenever our relationships got rocky, we would blame the guy for being insensitive, unavailable, or just plain shady. We truly believed that most men were frogs and we were going to have to kiss a lot of them to find our prince. But now I had seen the light. Men weren't the cause of all our headaches, we were. If a guy didn't act exactly the way we wanted him to, we would freak out, overreact, and drive him away.<br><br>Take Adison's new relationship for example. This guy, Gavin, did like her. There was definitely a mutual attraction when they began dating. However, Adison started assuming that they were in a relationship after only a couple of weeks, whereas Gavin was still testing the waters. She switched into full girlfriend mode before Gavin had really decided how he felt about her. So when she started coming on strong, calling a lot and making all-weekend plans with him, he started to back off.<br><br>This, of course, drove Adison crazy. And the crazier she got, the more she pressured him. The more she pressured him, the less he wanted to see her. She became angry and critical whenever they were together and accused Gavin of being immature for wanting to spend more time with his friends instead of hanging out with her. On the flip side, Gavin was becoming more and more convinced that Adison was trying to control him. For God's sake, they had only been dating for a month! Eventually Gavin stopped returning her calls all together, leaving Adison in relationship limbo, wondering what had happened. <br>Adison and I spent the next hour dissecting all of our previous relationships. In almost every instance, we realized that the guys we had thought were jerks were really not so bad after all. We just blamed them for the fact that the relationships had gone awry. We had come up with every excuse in the book for why they behaved badly, when really, we just didn't know how to act with a guy we liked. It didn't matter that Adison was a smart, pretty girl. The way she behaved completely turned guys off. What an epiphany! I had to laugh at all the crazy mistakes we had made throughout the years. Looking back, I wondered how I could have been so oblivious. <br><br>Suddenly, Adison became panic stricken.<br>'Ohmigod, Jess, do you know what this means?' She shrieked. 'I have been dumped three times in the last year, and I am now realizing it's because of something I'm doing. I'm turning guys off. All this time I thought I was just dating the wrong kind of guy. It never occurred to me that I might be bad at dating. Now what am I supposed to do?'<br><br>Good question. At the time, I didn't have the answer. I just knew that this problem wasn't unique to Adison and me. All of my friends were suffering from their own dating dilemmas as well. The more I thought about it, the more I was certain. It wasn't the guys that were making our lives miserable. It was us!<br>OK, So It's Me. Now What?<br><br>Years later I was in Las Vegas with my good friend Lana. We were attending a conference to promote her latest children's video. After a couple hours of standing on our feet, we decided to take a break and get some lunch. We found a restaurant in the casino and quickly grabbed a seat. A few minutes later, two guys sat down at the table right next to us. The one on my side was extremely cute, and I couldn't help but overhear his conversation. He had just closed a huge deal. One of the networks had agreed to fund his TV pilot. After a couple of minutes I realized 'cute guy' kept glancing my way. After the fifth or sixth time, I finally decided to catch his eye. He smiled at me, and I leaned over to him and said, 'You guys sound like you're celebrating.' <br>Ten minutes later we were engrossed in conversation. <br><br>Twenty minutes later 'cute guy'' asked for my number.<br>I could go into more details about how the weekend unfolded. How 'cute guy' (his name was Daniel) showed up at the club we were at that night. He bought us drinks, held my hand, and kept telling me how adorable I was. But the particulars of that evening are trivial. After all, lots of boys and girls meet and party in Vegas. The crazy part was what happened the next morning. As I went downstairs to check out, Daniel was waiting for me in the lobby. He begged and pleaded with me to stay another night. He even offered to pay for another room at his hotel. When it became clear I wasn't going to be convinced, he reluctantly let me go. But not before telling me that I was the most amazing woman he's ever met and making me promise I would see him again.<br><br>When Lana and I jumped in a cab to the airport, she looked at me with amazement and said, 'How is it that every guy falls in love with you?'<br>I had to laugh.<br><br>'No seriously,' she continued. 'When I was single I had guys hit on me, but they didn't fall all over themselves the way they do for you. It took weeks, usually months, to get them to commit. I feel like that guy would have reserved the Chapel o' Love tomorrow if you had let him. How do you do it?' <br>It was at that moment that I realized I had to write this book. I had a secret, and it was time to share it.<br><br>The Girl I Used to Be <br>As I said before, I wasn't always so successful with men. Even after my 'It's not him, it's you' epiphany years earlier, I still had my share of dating disasters.<br>In college, I had an on-and-off relationship with a guy named Shawn. I really liked him, and when we started dating again my junior year, I thought we were finally on the same page. I asked him to my sorority formal which happened to fall on my twenty-first birthday. I was very excited that I would be spending such a big night with a guy I really liked. On top of that, all my friends would be there to celebrate. However, two days before my birthday he called to tell me he couldn't go with me anymore. The girl he really liked had just asked him to go to her formal on the same night. I was devastated. I felt rejected. I never wanted to see him again. Unfortunately he lived next door.<br><br>Another time I fell hard for a Sigma Chi who lived upstairs from me. He would come over all the time and we'd eat, watch TV, and make out. We never defined our relationship, but since we hung out so much, I figured there was no need. He was my boyfriend, as far as I was concerned. Then one day I overheard a couple girls on the quad talking about him. I listened in and learned that he had been pining away for one of their cheerleader friends who finally decided to go out with him. The next time I saw him he was holding hands with C-H-R-I-S-S-Y from the squad.<br><br>Then there was Danny. I dated Danny for eleven months. I call that time period the Crash of '99. I was head over heels for him. Funny thing was, at first he chased me. He wanted to take me out and I kept turning him down. He called and pursued relentlessly. Eventually I caved in and went out with him. After seeing him a few times after that, I was hooked. The tables were turned, and now I was the one pining after him while he scheduled me in between rounds of golf. My entire week revolved around Danny. If he wanted to hang out, I dropped everything and ran over. I never knew when I was going to see him again, so I took every chance I got. I stopped making plans with friends because I didn't want to be somewhere that I couldn't leave in case he called. It was a disastrous relationship. I was absolutely powerless, and I didn't know how to regain control. So eventually after many tears, I finally left Danny. He had a new girlfriend three days after we broke up.<br><br>So as you can see, I've had my fair share of sob stories. Realizing that I didn't know how to date was only the beginning. I knew that I had a problem&#x2015;I just didn't know how to fix it. <br><br>Luckily, after college I stumbled upon the formula for dating success. I had figured out how to get a guy interested, keep control, and get him to commit. My love life took off, and guys who had never noticed me before were falling all over themselves to ask me out. Whereas before, I couldn't catch the eye of the captain of the chess team, I was now dating celebrities and professional athletes. I was even pursued by one of Fortune's 40 Richest Men Under 40. Guys were telling me they were in love with me after only a matter of weeks, and all of my boyfriends were discussing marriage. It was crazy, but it felt great. I couldn't believe the change. I was the same person I had always been, but now I was getting the response I had always wanted. <br><br>Since I discovered this secret, I have not been dumped, stood up, cheated on, or left in limbo wondering where I stood. I have had men go to great lengths to get my number and they have all asked for a commitment without me having to say one word. But the best part of all is that I no longer have to settle for the guys that just want me. I can pick any guy I want, and I know I can make him want me right back. <br><br>So what's my secret? How do I do it? It's all laid out right here in this book. And what exactly is the difference between this book and all those others out there? Simple. This book is not based on opinion or secondhand advice. It will not just help you understand men and why they do the things they do. What good is having that information if you don't know how to use it? No, this book is different. It will teach you exactly how to gain control of your love life and make you effective in dating, regardless of who you are or what you look like.<br><br>Now be prepared. This book presents some rather unorthodox advice. But that's a good thing. How many other dating books have you read that have done absolutely nothing for you? This book is different. It won't be like The Rules. It does not contain flimsy outdated advice my mother's mother gave me.

Indeed, Mr. Gould has accomplished something rare: his extensive research into the anthropology and sociobiology of spouse exchange has allowed him to broaden his descriptions of swing parties to include deeply significant explanations for what takes place at them. Few journalists have gained permission to enter that world, and none have explained it in such depth. 'The Lifestyle' is an entertaining, on-the-scene narrative, but it is also a serious work which should be read by all who want to understand what this growing phenomenon is all about."<br>- Josef P. Skala, m.d., ph.d., frcp(c), Professor Emeritus, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia </p><p> "It is clearly the most objective and well-researched work on the subject we have seen."<br>- a swinging couple interviewed for EXTRA </p></blockquote> <p>The lifestyle has grown so quickly in recent years that, wherever you live, you won't have trouble finding it. It is not an underground movement or a cult. It is a public, grass-roots, heterosexual orientation among mainstream couples who claim to have overcome the kind of loneliness, jealousy, and shame adulterous marrieds endure.<br>(from <b>The Lifestyle</b>) )</p><p> "I hate when jerks call the lifestyle wife swapping," Jim averred. "I hate that term and what it implies. By that I mean a woman being forced into something because her husband says, 'Look honey, let's go.' To me that's abuse.

Is it possible to experience sex with other partners while happily ensconced in an emotionally monogamous marriage? Is swinging merely an invention of sexually permissive modern times? </p><p> As award-winning journalist Terry Gould discovered, the phenomenon has roots that go back thousands of years and also seems to be motivated by a deeper biological urge: the drive to seek long-term partners and the equally powerful drive for sexual and genetic variety. </p><p> Part expose and certainly a debunking of the 'wife-swapping' myth, <b>The Lifestyle</b> is a serious examination of a taboo subject, brought forward intelligently, compassionately, without sensationalism or judgment, and backed by extensive research across North America. </p><p> It includes numerous interviews with the originators and leaders of the Lifestyle movement.

These are the questions that arose as award-winning investigative journalist Terry Gould embarked upon a journey through a thriving subculture known as "the lifestyle."<br><br>Ignored, dismissed or denigrated by the mainstream media, ordinary, married couples in the lifestyle are now getting together to openly express their erotic fantasies.

Barlaam was working on the problem of union between the Roman and Byzantine churches in the 1330s and actually acted as the representative of the Orthodox church. In his discussions, in which he repudiated the use of filioque (the addition to the Creed of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son), he argued for the unknowable and unapproachable nature of God. Gregory did not take kindly to what he perceived to be agnostic tendencies in Barlaam&#x2019;s thought, and he wrote a treatise about the procession of the Holy Spirit. However, it was particularly Barlaam&#x2019;s later attack on the hesychasts, a certain group of Orthodox monks, that led to a bitter debate between Gregory and Barlaam. Several basic issues were involved, centering on man&#x2019;s knowledge of God. The ideas that were defined in the debate by Palamas became crucial for the future of Eastern Orthodox thought.</p><p>Rein Ferwerda, who received his Ph.D. in Classics from the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, served as rector of Marnix College in Ede, the Netherlands. Having already gained international fame as an expert on Plotinus, he became well known in the Netherlands as translator of the Enneads of Plotinus as well as works by Sextus Empiricus, Diogenes Laertius, Empedocles and Aristotle. <p> Sara J. Denning-Bolle received her Ph.D. in Ancient Near Eastern history from UCLA under the guidance of Giorgio Buccellati. Her work on wisdom in the ancient Near East (Wisdom in Akkadian Literature: Expression, Instruction. Dialogue, 1992) led her to inquire into the dialogue form in a wider area, including Platonic dialogue, dialogue in Justin Martyr, and, at present, dialogue in the work of Gregory Palamas.</p>While Palamas emphasizes that the mystical vision reveals God&#39;s ultimate simplicity, it is clear that the mystical experience itself remains a complex and transcendental matter: the mystic can never separate himself from his tradition with the result that the experience is forever culturally and historically colored.</p><h2>I&#39;m With the Band: Confessions of a Groupie</h2><p>The author recounts her experiences at the center of the rock world, with stars such as Keith Moon, Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page, Waylon Jennings, and Jim Morrison</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No Bio<br><br>No BioFortunately, Des Barres injects humor into these accounts of degradation, which exemplify the subculture of rock music. As a California teenager during the wild 1960s, she attached herself to members of various rock bands and other celebrities. More bragging than confessional, the story explicitly details this particular groupie's sexual exploits with Mick Jagger, the late Brandon de Wilde, Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page (he liked using whips and handcuffs to enhance sex, we're told here), future Miami Vice star Don Johnson and many others. Now in her 30s, Des Barres has recovered from longtime drug abuse as has her husband, Michael, a musician. Though still "making the scene," they have settled down somewhat, as parents of a son. There are profoundly sad, shocking revelations here, and the reader understands why John Lennon glanced at the groupie and her adolescent female gang in 1964, "his face full of contempt and sorrow."

(&#34;Guardian&#34;). It is London in the late 1930s and sixteen-year-old orphan Portia is plunged into the sophisticated and politely treacherous world of her wealthy half-brother&#39;s home. Wide-eyed and disconcertingly vulnerable, Portia encounters the attractive, carefree cad Eddie. To him, Portia is at once child and woman, and he fears her gushing love. To her, Eddie is the only reason to be alive. But when Eddie follows Portia to a sea-side resort, the flash of a cigarette lighter in a darkened cinema illuminates a stunning romantic betrayal - and sets in motion one of the most moving and desperate flights of the heart in modern literature.</p><p>Five words of advice on reading Elizabeth Bowen: Resist the urge to skim. In <i>The Death of the Heart</i>, Bowen's writing rolls ever onward, accruing the sensations and ironies of conscious living till the final effect is massive. This is not prose for people who like their fiction with a cool, Calvin Klein-like minimalism. Bowen's people are keenly aware, and she seems to catalogue every sweaty moment, every betraying glance. The reader must stay right there with her, because hidden among lengthy descriptions of sea air and drawing-room politics are pithy asides worthy of great humorists: "Absence blots people out. We really have no absent friends." Skimmers miss out.<p> <i>The Death of the Heart</i> is Bowen's most perfectly made book. Portia, an orphan, comes to live in London with her half-brother, Thomas, and his wife, Anna. A child of sin raised in a series of shabby French hotels, Portia is possessed of a kind of terrible innocence. Like Chance the Gardener in pigtails, she literally can't comprehend evil or unkind motives. Unfortunately for her, she falls in with Anna's friend Eddie, who seems to be made entirely of bad motives. Though the plot follows Portia's relationship with Eddie, the novel's real tension lies between Portia and Anna, as the girl comes to grief against the shoals of Anna's glittering, urbane cynicism. But the book transcends the theme of innocence corrupted. As in Graham Greene's <i>The Quiet American</i>, Bowen inverts the formula to show the destructive power of innocence itself: </p><blockquote>Innocence so constantly finds itself in a false position that inwardly innocent people learn to be disingenuous.... Incurable strangers to the world, they never cease to exact a heroic happiness. Their singleness, their ruthlessness, their one continuous wish makes them bound to be cruel, and to suffer cruelty. The innocent are so few that two of them seldom meet--and when they do, their victims lie strewn all around.</blockquote> Bowen has a fine eye for such shadings of morality, but finer still is her understanding of the way humans bump up against the material world. Her writing on weather, both emotional and meteorological, compares with the best of Henry James: "One's first day by the sea, one's being feels salt, strong, resilient, and hollow--like a seaweed pod not giving under the heel."<p> Always a sensitive observer of the way we live, in her lesser books Bowen deals in mind games and then delivers trumped-up, bloody endings. In <i>The Death of the Heart</i>, she keeps all the action between her characters' ears, and comes up with one of the great midcentury psychological novels. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Elizabeth Bowen is widely considered to be one of the greatest novelists of this century. While her novels masquerade as witty comedies of manners, set in the lavish country houses of the Anglo-Irish or in elegant London homes, they mine the depths of private tragedy with a subtle ferocity and psychological complexity reminiscent of Henry James.<p>The Death of the Heart, a story of adolescent love and the betrayal of innocence, is perhaps Bowen's best-known book. When sixteen-year-old Portia, recently orphaned, arrives in London and falls for an attractive cad -- a seemingly carefree young man who is as much an outsider in the sophisticated and politely treacherous world of 1930s drawing rooms as she is -- their collision threatens to shatter the carefully built illusions of everyone around them. As she deftly and delicately exposes the cruelty that lurks behind the polished surfaces of conventional society, Bowen reveals herself as a masterful novelist who combines a sharp sense of humor with a devastating gift for divining human motivations.</p></p><h2>The Cat-Nappers</h2><p>Assigned by his Aunt Dahlia to cat-nap the good-luck companion of a racehorse against which she has bet heavily, Bertie Wooster enlists the assistance of his valet, Jeeves, in the scheme</p><p>Bertie and his valet, Jeeves, are embroiled once again in a scheme developed by Bertie&#39;s Aunt Dahlia.</p><h2>Last Dog on the Hill: The Extraordinary Life of Lou</h2><p><p><b><i>The moving story of the author's adopted Rottweiler mix, Lou, a free-thinking heroic dog who changed his life forever </i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br><b><i></i></b>Born of guard dogs on a secret marijuana farm in Mendicino County, Lou truly was one dog in a million. On the winter day that the ailing, tick-infested feral pup was rescued by Steve Duno, neither dog nor man had a clue as to what they were getting into, or where the relationship would lead. </p><p><i>Last Dog on the Hill </i>tells the story of an indigent young Rottweiler mix who, after abandoning his pack and the hills of his birth, went on to change the lives of hundreds of people and dogs, including the author's, whose career as a behaviorist and writer was made possible through Lou's extraordinary intelligence and heart. Lou won the respect of gang members, foiled an armed robbery, caught a rapist, fought coyotes and kidnappers, comforted elderly war veterans and Alzheimer patients in their final days, taught ASL to kids, learned scores of unique behaviors and tricks, amassed a vocabulary of nearly 200 words, helped rehabilitate hundreds of aggressive dogs and saved them from euthanasia. He was also a clown, consummate performer and Steve's best friend for sixteen years. His story will make readers laugh and cry in equal measures.</p></p><p><p><i>Last Dog on the Hill </i>is veteran pet behaviorist STEVE DUNO's eighteenth book.

The black hairs were odorless but his undercoat still held scent, and I&#x2019;d lift some of him up to my nose and be back in the mountains with him, listening to coyotes or owls, or to mice nibbling on the tent fly. In death he had spoken to me in a way he knew I would best appreciate. His smell, still there in the carpet, sidestepped my brain and went straight for the heart, where the memories are.<br>The essential crime committed against all dog owners is born of the love we hold for them, which, like the love of a child, runs deep. No parent should have to bury a child, they say, but that is what we dog owners must do, not once but time after time, throughout our lives. While we remain unchangeable to their sweet eyes, they run from birth to the grave in an instant of our own mea sure. They burn like kindling, and though we know we can never replace one dog with another, we keep trying, in hopes of reviving hints of some great dog gone by. No; they are not children we bury. But dogs like Lou come close. They come very, very close.<br>Highway 101 sweeps north into the small Mendocino County town of Willits, California, gateway to redwood country, home to vineyards and fast rivers, and to the resting place of Seabiscuit, the great race horse.

Upon arriving, I renewed an old fascination with dogs, one I&#x2019;d first nurtured in childhood. Living in a one-bedroom New York tenement with my parents and brother, I&#x2019;d asked for a dog but had gotten only a pale blue parakeet named Chipper, a bitter bird who&#x2019;d bend apart the bars of his cage and escape, to strafe our heads and scream his discontent.<br>In Los Angeles I read scores of books about breeding, training manuals, and pet magazines until I fancied myself a bookish &#x201c;authority.&#x201d; I thought I was ready for a dog of my choosing. Then chance changed the course of my life, and the lives of so many others.<br>My girlfriend Nancy and I took a few December days off, packed the car, and drove up Highway 101 toward Northern California. The entire West Coast had fine weather; we took our time, often detouring over to the coast in places to enjoy the scenery.<br>North of Ukiah, in Mendocino County, the highway snaked through the countryside. Halfway through a long, right sweeper, we spotted furry shapes porpoising up a steep grassy hill, toward the tree line above.<br>&#x201c;Puppies!&#x201d; said Nancy. We pulled over onto the wide shoulder and got out.<br>On the crest of the hill a half-dozen dogs scampered for the cover of trees; midsized, dark-coated mutts with shepherd looks, tongues flagging, teeth bright in the sun.<br>&#x201c;Five, six months old,&#x201d; I said, suddenly aware of a much larger creature lying by the shoulder ahead, half hidden in the grass. An enormous Rottweiler, he basked in the sun like a Dakota buffalo, his black-and-tan coat dusted with dirt. And in his mouth rested the tawny snout of a limp, road-killed deer.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go near him,&#x201d; I said, the deer&#x2019;s snout crunching like a carrot stick in his jaws.<br>&#x201c;Not a chance,&#x201d; Nancy said, more interested in the puppies, who had a lithe, black, shepherd mix with them, perhaps their mother.<br>The Rottweiler gnawed away thoughtfully and watched us.<br>Following their skittish mother up into the tree line, the pups were nearly out of sight. I gave a quick whistle just to see what would happen; all but one scampered off. But the last dog on the hill stopped, gazed down at the road, then made a mad downhill dash toward us, as if recognizing someone.<br>Black and tan, it looked more like a diminutive Rottweiler than did the others. Like a Looney Tunes character, the quick little mutt skidded to a stop right in front of us, dropped into a perfect soldier-sit, then stared up at me like I was Simon Cowell. It was Lou.<br>Those lucky enough to meet Lou were struck by his soulful eyes, riveting good looks and brotherly charm. People simply couldn&#x2019;t get enough of him. But the dog sitting politely in front of me that day was anything but debonair. At most six months old, he had an infected tear on his throat, and ticks peppering his face and body. The bloated bugs hung like Christmas ornaments, even from the corners of his eyes and mouth and inside his ears and nose.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s infested,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And look at that gash.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Look at his eyes,&#x201d; Nancy said, grinning. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s gorgeous.&#x201d;<br>Lou looked up at me and let out an interrogative, &#x201c;Rower?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That gash is infected. And who knows anything about him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But look at him,&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Look at those eyes.&#x201d;<br>I felt Lou&#x2019;s warm breath on my hand. The sound of his dad crunching deer snout punctuated the swish of cars passing by.<br>I petted him. He looked at me like I was Mother Teresa. Fleas popped off his head like seltzer bubbles and ricocheted off the palm of my hand.<br>As I stood there wondering what to do, a pug-nosed Freight-liner pulling a load of timber hit its air brakes and snorted to a stop across the road, onto the shoulder. Out popped a gritty little guy in Levi&#x2019;s and a dirty white T-shirt. He shuffled across 101 as if wearing leg irons.<br>&#x201c;The biggun yours?&#x201d; he asked, pointing to the Rottweiler with a shaky cigarette, looking like he&#x2019;d been up for a week.<br>&#x201c;Biggun?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;The biggun chawin&#x2019; on doe face,&#x201d; he said, bouncing on the balls of his feet.<br>The deer&#x2019;s snout secure in his mouth, the Rottweiler eyed the little trucker. The big dog was thoughtful and calm, a first clue, perhaps, to what his son would become. I remember thinking at the time that this dog could kill us all without much fanfare, then go back to his venison sashimi. He didn&#x2019;t, of course; he simply took the mea sure of the trucker for a moment, then kept chewing.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s part of a pack of strays that just ran up the slope,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Bitchin&#x2019; truck dog.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said, picturing the jumpy little guy sideways in the big dog&#x2019;s mouth.<br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll take him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh I wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Nancy.<br>&#x201c;I got a way with dogs.&#x201d;<br>Before the trucker could commit suicide by Rottweiler, a park-ranger pickup pulled over and a boyish-faced fellow got out, plugged on his ranger hat, and came over.<br>&#x201c;Howdy, folks,&#x201d; he said, eyes on the Rottweiler and doe.<br>&#x201c;Gonna shoot him?&#x201d; asked the trucker.<br>The Rottie dropped the doe and shook drool from his rubbery black lips.<br>&#x201c;No. If he&#x2019;d downed this deer on his own, we&#x2019;d have to deal with him, but this was roadkill from last night. I saw it at sunrise on the side of the road.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Rower,&#x201d; said Lou.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d kill a dog if it hunted down a deer?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Stray dogs that hunt deer get euthanized.&#x201d; He seemed too nice of a guy to shoot a dog.<br>&#x201c;Who owns him?&#x201d; asked the trucker, scuffling his cowboy boots in the dirt, moving closer to the Rottie.<br>&#x201c;This big boy and the shepherd bitch up the hill are guard dogs from a marijuana grow over on the other side of this ridge. This time of year there&#x2019;s not much to protect, so they just wander about, looking for food.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Marijuana grow?&#x201d; asked Nancy.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Patches of pot grow all through here, mostly on national forest land. Big cash crop. Not much else to do around these parts.&#x201d;<br>Lou scratched himself, then looked up at me sweetly, calm but impatient, as if he&#x2019;d made up his mind about us and expected the same.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing this one and the pups up on the hill are his,&#x201d; said the ranger. &#x201c;Dad and Junior here seem sociable, but the rest are wild. A local rescue group tried to catch them last week, but they&#x2019;re too cagey.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I like that biggun,&#x201d; said the trucker, rubbing his furrowed neck and snickering like a kid.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d think twice about him,&#x201d; said the ranger. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a reason why he hasn&#x2019;t spooked yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about him?&#x201d; I asked, petting Lou on his head, the fleas flying.<br>&#x201c;Tame, isn&#x2019;t he? I bet he&#x2019;d go with you. Lean and cut up, though. Might have gotten caught up on some barbed wire.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing that can&#x2019;t be fixed,&#x201d; said Nancy, already deep in Lou&#x2019;s camp.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re four hundred miles from home,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He needs a vet and he&#x2019;s infested.&#x201d;<br>I had imagined it this way: find a caring breeder, choose the perfect, healthy pup, frame the pedigree, and live happily ever after. I hadn&#x2019;t planned on making a snap decision beside the road with giant dogs and dead deer and caffeinated truckers and ganja fields and boyish rangers and sweet gypsy eyes looking up at me, wondering when we&#x2019;d be going home.<br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t want him, I&#x2019;ll take him,&#x201d; said the trucker, laughing oddly, as if he&#x2019;d decided to slow-roast Lou at the next rest area.<br>Nancy giggled. She knew what pushed my buttons.<br>The big Rottie let go a thick stream of pee onto the asphalt, then stretched his back legs out one at a time. I wondered if Lou would get that big.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a vet in Willits as you come into town,&#x201d; said the ranger. He had a slow, bearish quality. I imagined him quietly tending to his own secreted pot patch. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Sunday morning, though; you might have to wake him up.&#x201d;<br>The Rottie...</p></p><h2>Vaudeville: The Birth of Show Business (First Books-Performances and Entertainment)</h2><p>Discusses the history of vaudeville including performances, theaters, and actors, and examines its influence on modern entertainment</p><p></p><h2>Vanishing Acts (Madison Kincaid)</h2><p><p>From tracking down her best friend, who&#x2019;s nowhere to be found, to secretly helping her attorney father solve a missing-person case, Madison Kincaid is a busy seventh-grade sleuth.

His name was Joseph Paxton (1803 1865), and he bestrode the worlds of horticulture, urban planning, and architecture like a colossus. This was the self-taught polymath who had a solution to every large-scale logistical problem, the genius whom an impossibly overworked Charles Dickens dubbed "The Busiest Man in England."<br><br>Rising quickly from humble beginnings, Paxton, at age 23, became head gardener and architect at Chatsworth, the estate of the sixth Duke of Devonshire. Under Paxton's direction, Chatsworth was transformed into the greatest garden in England, a paradise of magnificent greenhouses, gravity-defying fountains, and innovative waterworks. Queen Victoria herself came to marvel; here was Britain's answer to the hanging gardens of Babylon.<br><br>But it was the Crystal Palace, home of the Great Exhibition of 1851, that secured Paxton's fame. Two thousand men worked for eight months to complete this unprecedented temporary structure of iron and glass. It was six times the size of St. Paul's Cathedral, and entertained six million visitors. In the wake of its spectacular success, Paxton was in constant demand to design public buildings and propose ways to ease congestion in London, then the world's most populous city.<br><br>An artist among researchers, Kate Colquhoun handles her complex subject as if she were born to biography.

A former Secret Service agent who was in the presidential motorcade during the John F. Kennedy assassination, Hill remained assigned to Mrs. Kennedy until after the 1964 election. He then was assigned to President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House and later to Richard Nixon, eventually becoming the Assistant Director of the Secret Service for all protection. He retired in 1975.Mrs. Kennedy and Me 1<br>Meeting Mrs. Kennedy<p></p> <br><br> <br>It was with great trepidation that I approached 3307 N Street in Georgetown on November 11, 1960. I was about to meet the wife of the newly elected president of the United States, who I had just been assigned to protect, and I wasn&#x2019;t looking forward to it at all. Being on the First Lady&#x2019;s Secret Service detail was the last place I wanted to be. Looking back, I&#x2019;m quite sure that Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy was filled with even more anxiety about our meeting than I was. Neither of us had much choice in the matter. She could refuse to accept me&#x2014;as she had done with the first agent assigned to her&#x2014;but if I rejected the assignment, it would be the end of my career.<br> <br>Just twenty-four hours earlier, I had been with outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower, as he played a post-election round of golf at Augusta National Golf Course. The fact that the Republicans had lost the election was still sinking in, and while the entire administration was about to change, one of the few things that would remain the same was the Secret Service. It had been a great honor for me to be on President Eisenhower&#x2019;s Secret Service detail, and, while it would be bittersweet to see him leave office, I was excited for the challenge and experience of protecting the new president. It never entered my mind that my job might not be as secure as I thought it was.<br> <br>There were just forty of us on the White House Secret Service detail&#x2014;the elite team whose sole mission was to protect the president around the clock. We were not affiliated with any party or political group, and we were a tight group of men. The transition would require the Secret Service to adapt to the new president&#x2019;s style, and even though I hadn&#x2019;t yet met President-elect John F. Kennedy, it was obvious that protecting him was going to be a whole different ball game than it had been with Ike. We were going from a seventy-year-old former general who ran the White House with military precision, to an energetic forty-three-year-old Irish Catholic Democrat from Massachusetts with a lot of new ideas to take America into the 1960s.<br> <br>I had been working the golf course with two other agents, and as soon as the president&#x2019;s foursome finished the round, Jim Rowley, the Special Agent in Charge (SAIC) of the White House Detail, sent word that he needed to speak to the three of us. I had a feeling that this was probably my last game of golf with President Eisenhower and fully expected that Rowley was about to reassign the three of us to President-elect Kennedy.<br> <br>When we walked into the office, Rowley explained that he had to shuffle the personnel in order to cover President Eisenhower, along with President-elect Kennedy, until the Inauguration in January.<br> <br>First he addressed the other two agents, Jerry Blaine and Bill Skiles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jerry and Bill, you&#x2019;ll be on the president-elect detail. Mr. Kennedy is going to spend the next month and the holidays at his father&#x2019;s estate in Palm Beach, Florida, so you guys need to get on a flight down there this evening.&#x201d;<br> <br>He warned that they would likely remain in Florida until the Inauguration, meaning they&#x2019;d be away from their own families for Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s, and suggested they have their wives arrange to get some warm-weather clothing to them. As I was listening to Rowley give Blaine and Skiles their new assignment, an uneasy feeling started to come over me.<br> <br>Finally, Rowley turned to me and said, &#x201c;Clint, Defense Secretary Tom Gates is here briefing the president and is returning to Washington shortly. I want you to fly back with him, then go to Secret Service headquarters and talk to Chief Baughman. The chief is expecting you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; I said with a nod. Why does Baughman want to speak with me? Why am I not going to Palm Beach with Skiles and Blaine? I had a dozen questions, but I would never question Rowley&#x2019;s authority or decision: he was our leader. Still, I had a foreboding feeling that whatever lay ahead for me could not be good.<br> <br>SECRET SERVICE HEADQUARTERS was located in the U.S. Treasury Building, right next to the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. I had never been in the chief&#x2019;s office before, and in fact, had never personally met Chief U. E. Baughman, who had been head of the Secret Service since 1948. I was more than a little apprehensive when I checked in with his secretary, but I tried to sound as confident as possible.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Special Agent Clint Hill. Here to meet with Chief Baughman.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mr. Hill, the chief is expecting you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You may go on in.&#x201d;<br> <br>As I walked through the doorway into the chief&#x2019;s spacious office, the first thing I saw was a plaque hanging on the wall that said: You ain&#x2019;t learning nothing when you&#x2019;re talking. Sound advice, I thought.<br> <br>Then, as I looked around the room, and saw not just Chief Baughman but his deputy chief and an assistant chief as well as two inspectors, a feeling of dread suddenly came over me. The entire top echelon of the Secret Service was standing there, apparently awaiting my arrival.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on in, Clint,&#x201d; Baughman said as he moved toward me and shook my hand. &#x201c;Have a seat and make yourself comfortable.&#x201d;<br> <br>His cordial manner seemed to be an attempt to help me relax, but I still had an uneasy feeling about why I had been summoned. After introducing me to the other men in the room, Baughman asked casually, &#x201c;Clint, how long have you been in the Secret Service?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I started in the Denver Field Office on September 22, 1958, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And when were you transferred to the White House Detail?&#x201d; Baughman asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just over one year ago. On November 1, 1959.&#x201d;<br> <br>This is strange, I thought. Surely all of this information is in my file.<br> <br>Baughman asked a couple of more innocuous questions, and then each of the other men began asking me things, all sorts of things about my past, both personal and professional, as well as my attitude about protective activities.<br> <br>What did you do prior to becoming an agent? Where did you grow up? Where did you go to college? Are you married or single? Do you have any children? Do you swim? Do you know how to play tennis? Have you ever ridden horses? I answered the barrage of inquiries as honestly and candidly as possible, but each new question increased my anxiety, as I still had no idea what this was all about. My mind was spinning as I replayed the events of the last couple of weeks, trying to figure out what I could have done wrong, and though my stomach was in knots, I did my best to stay calm and composed.<br> <br>At times, the men would go off into a corner of the room and confer, just out of earshot, so I couldn&#x2019;t hear what was being discussed. I was thoroughly convinced that I was about to be fired. Why else wouldn&#x2019;t I have been sent to Palm Beach?<br> <br>The interrogation went on for nearly one and a half hours. One and a half hours in which I&#x2019;d done all the talking, and just like it said on Baughman&#x2019;s plaque, I hadn&#x2019;t learned a damn thing.<br> <br>Finally, Baughman said, &#x201c;Clint, we have made a decision. You are being assigned to protect Mrs. John F. Kennedy. Jim Jeffries is the leader of the First Lady&#x2019;s Detail and you&#x2019;ll be his assistant.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was too stunned to speak. The First Lady&#x2019;s Detail? Me? But why?<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; I said. There was nothing more to say. I was relieved that I wasn&#x2019;t being fired, but I was deeply disappointed that I wasn&#x2019;t going to be with the new president.<br> <br>Baughman told me to report to 3307 N Street Northwest, to the Kennedy home in Georgetown. Mrs. Kennedy would soon be arriving from Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.<br> <br>My mind was spinning as I left the chief&#x2019;s office. Why was I selected for this assignment? What actions or experience in my background caused them to make this decision? It felt as though I had been demoted from the starting lineup to the bench. From grade school to college, in all my years playing football, basketball, and baseball, I&#x2019;d always been a star player, and now, in the most important game of my life, I&#x2019;d just been kicked off the first team. I was devastated.<br> <br>The more I thought about it, the more upset I became. I had been on the White House Detail for just over a year and had traveled with President Eisenhower on several unprecedented trips that took us throughout Europe, Asia, and South America. At the time, I was twenty-seven years old and had never flown in a jet aircraft. Having grown up in the high plains of North Dakota, I could never have imagined I would accompany the President of the United States to ancient cities I&#x2019;d only read about in history books: Rome, Ankara, Karachi, Kabul, New Delhi, Tehran, Athens, Tunis, Toulon, Paris, Lisbon, and Casablanca. To top things off, I was issued a diplomatic passport, which allowed for preferential treatment, as if I were a dignitary myself. I felt so privileged and I thrived on the constant activity.<br> <br>One of the things I most enjoyed was the camaraderie among all the agents as we worked together as a team. Now all that excitement was over, and I could just envision what lay ahead. While my buddies on the President&#x2019;s Detail would be right in the middle of all the action, I knew where I was going to end up: fashion shows, afternoon tea parties, and the ballet. I felt as if my career had come to a screeching halt.<br> <br>I pulled my Secret Service commission book out of my suit coat pocket and held it in my hands. The impressive midnight blue grosgrain leather case was engraved on the front cover with the gold five-point Secret Service star. Within the star it read: UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE.<br> <br>As I went over and over in my mind what had just transpired, the only conclusion I could come to as to why I&#x2019;d been chosen for this assignment was that Mrs. Kennedy and I were fairly close in age&#x2014;I was now twenty-eight and she was thirty-one&#x2014;and that I had a child nearly the same age as her three-year-old daughter Caroline. I couldn&#x2019;t come up with any other reason.<br> <br>I finally realized I had no recourse. I was a Secret Service agent on the White House Detail, and the first lady required protection. Somebody had to do it. So I pulled myself up, grabbed the keys to one of the Secret Service sedans, and headed to the historic streets of Georgetown.<br> <br>THE THREE-STORY REDBRICK townhouse at 3307 N Street stood so close to the street that the front door was just two steps up from the sidewalk. The house was not very big&#x2014;just three windows across on the upper two floors and two windows next to the front door on the ground floor.<br> <br>The Secret Service agent posted in front of the house had been alerted to my arrival and allowed me inside without difficulty. Agent Jim Jeffries was waiting inside and came to the door to greet me.<br> <br>Agent Jeffries was about five foot ten, the same height as me, with a medium build, and was about thirty-two or thirty-three years old. He had light, reddish hair, and a ruddy complexion, which I imagined would burn to a crisp if he spent more than a few minutes in the sun. As he approached me, he had a serious, almost stern look on his face that didn&#x2019;t do much to calm the apprehension I was already feeling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on in, Clint,&#x201d; he said, in a clipped voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jim Jeffries. Glad to have you aboard. Let me go find Mrs. Kennedy and introduce you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Great. I&#x2019;m looking forward to meeting her,&#x201d; I said, with as much sincerity as I could muster.<br> <br>As Jeffries walked out, I looked around the living room to try to get a feel for Mrs. Kennedy&#x2019;s tastes and what kinds of things she liked. The room was elegantly decorated, but it had a feeling of warmth to it as well. Dark wood antiques were mixed with light-colored upholstered pieces and the furniture seemed as if it were arranged in such a way to invite guests to stay for long, lingering evenings by the fireplace. Built-in bookshelves were filled with a mixture of books and decorative ornaments that had a distinctly European feel. Everything seemed to be placed just so, and I got the feeling that should an object be moved ever so slightly, it would be noticed immediately. It was a home for tea parties and ladies&#x2019; luncheons. Just thinking about it made the feelings of disgust and disappointment wash over me again in a sudden wave.<br> <br>After a few minutes, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy walked into the room, with Agent Jeffries a few steps behind.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d seen newspaper photographs of her, of course, but in person she was much more striking than I had imagined. She was tall&#x2014;about five foot seven inches&#x2014;but it was the way she carried herself, almost gliding into the room with a dancer&#x2019;s erect posture, that exuded an air of quiet confidence. Her chin-length, dark brown hair was perfectly coiffed, and she wore just a touch of makeup, enough to accentuate her dark brown eyes and full lips but still look natural. She was very attractive, very gracious, and very pregnant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Kennedy,&#x201d; Jeffries said matter-of-factly, &#x201c;this is Clint Hill. He will be the second agent for your personal protection.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Kennedy approached me and smiled warmly as she offered her hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Hill,&#x201d; she said in a soft, breathy voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very nice to meet you, too, Mrs. Kennedy,&#x201d; I said with a smile, as I shook her hand and looked directly into her eyes. She returned my gaze for an instant, then blinked and looked away, giving me the impression that, while she wanted to appear confident, on the inside she was rather shy.<br> <br>The three of us sat down in the living room, as Agent Jeffries took the lead in explaining our duties, and how we would need to work with Mrs. Kennedy and her staff.<br> <br>&#x201c;There will be various agents assigned to handle the perimeter security of your residence&#x2014;whether that&#x2019;s here, the White House, Palm Beach, or Hyannis Port&#x2014;at all times. Either Mr. Hill or I will be with you whenever you leave the residence, and if you travel outside of Washington, both of us will accompany you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The smile had worn off Mrs. Kennedy&#x2019;s face as she resigned herself to the fact that, from now on, she would never be alone.<br> <br>Calmly, in a measured tone, her voice almost whisper-like, she said, &#x201c;Well, you don&#x2019;t have to worry about me traveling in the next few weeks. My baby is due in a month and I plan to stay here in Washington. My biggest concern, really, is maintaining as much privacy as possible&#x2014;not only for me, but for Caroline and the new baby, as well. I don&#x2019;t want us to feel like animals in a zoo, and I certainly don&#x2019;t want someone following me around like a puppy dog.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her gaze transferred between Jeffries and me, making sure that both of us understood her wishes.<br> <br>&#x201c;I also know that as soon as the baby is born, the press will be overbearing. They can be so intrusive.&#x201d; She pressed her lips together, turning her mouth into a sly smile, and looking directly at me, she added, &#x201c;I used to be one of them, you know, and I&#x2019;m well aware of how they operate.&#x201d;<br> <br>In that instant, I realized that Mrs. Kennedy was a lot more intuitive and in control than her public image at the time suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mrs. Kennedy,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;Part of our job will be to protect you from the press, and to make sure that you and your children can live as normal a life as possible. Believe me, we don&#x2019;t like the press any more than you do.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her smile widened for an instant, and then she stood up and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been lovely meeting you, gentlemen. Now I have some things to attend to.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jeffries and I stood up as Mrs. Kennedy walked out of the room. She had decided the meetin...</p><h2>Virtual History Alternatives and Counterfactuals</h2><p>What if Britain had stayed out of the First World War? What if Germany had won the Second? What if the Soviet Union had won the Third?<br>Far from being the result of determinist laws, what actually happened in the past was only one of a number of plausible outcomes. Indeed, to contemporaries, it may not even have been the most likely. To understand what did happen, we therefore need to understand what might have happened.<br>Beginning in the seventeenth century with the English Civil War and ending with the collapse of Communism in the 1990s Virtual History explores what would have happened if nine momentous events had turned out differently. The answers it provides are not fiction because each solution is strictly based on the alternatives which we know contemporaries contemplated.<br>The result not only illuminates the actual course of events but also gives us a compelling glimpse of the 'parallel worlds' which could have been: An absolutist, Catholic England. An America opting for British rule instead of independence. A united but British Ireland. A Europe economically dominated by Germany as early as 1915. An England occupied by the Nazis. A world without the Cold War. An ageing Kennedy, bogged down in Vietnam. And a triumphant Soviet Union, gloating at the collapse of capitalism after 1989.</p><p>This meaty, scholarly collection of essays by gifted historian Niall Ferguson tackles the controversial topic of counterfactual questions: What if Hitler had invaded Britain in WWII? What if JFK had survived his assassination? What if there had been no Gorbachev to usher in the collapse of Communism? What if there had been no American Revolution? Ferguson points out that while questions such as these are a vital part of how we learn as individuals ("What if I had observed the speed limit, or refused that last drink?"), there remains a great deal of resistance--even hostility--to such musings among professional historians. "[I]n the dismissive phrase of E.H. Carr, 'counterfactual' history is a mere 'parlour game,' a 'red herring.'" E.P. Thompson is less charitable, calling counterfactual histories "' <i>Geschichtswissenschlopff</i>', unhistorical shit." <p> But Ferguson and his distinguished collaborators (many of whom are also Oxford fellows) lodge some convincing counterfactuals of their own to counter this arguably blinkered notion, this "idea that events are in some way preprogrammed, so that what was, had to be." In addition to the what-ifs above, Ferguson and his comrades tackle eight questions in all, including "What if Charles I had avoided the Civil War?", "What if Home Rule had been enacted [in Ireland] in 1912?", and "What if Britain had 'stood aside' in August 1914?" <i>Virtual History</i> makes for a stimulating and intellectually rigorous trip, with Ferguson's own delightful afterword as the collection's crowning jewel, a brilliant--and often bitingly clever--timeline tying together all the threads from 1646 to 1996. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Niall Ferguson is one of Britain&#39;s most renowned historians.

Read Joyce's story and find out Joyce Ritchie was living a wonderful life with a great family and a thriving career. While a long time Christian, she admits her relationship with Jesus was fairly superficial. Her life began to unravel, though, when her health mysteriously began to fail. She earnestly sought answers about her life and about Jesus. She dug deeper into who Jesus really was and who she really was in Him. Realizing how superficial her Christian walk had been, she also prayed for a deeper faith. These prayers were answered, but not in the way she expected. Her life began to crumble around her as she found her marriage in a precarious position. Seeking counseling, she soon found herself battling flashbacks, body memories that were complete with the dry heaves, and a spiritual battle she was ill prepared for when she began to realize her childhood was not what she had always assumed. Joyce takes the reader deep into her journey of battling a chronic illness and recovering memories of childhood sexual abuse. Her story is powerful, personal, and vulnerable. She opens her journals and her counseling sessions, allowing us to experience the pain, anger, shame, loneliness and feelings of guilt...but also to share in the victories, the spiritual lessons, the freedom, and the ultimate deep relationship she gained with Jesus along the way. Jesus wants to heal our hearts, and this book underscores how He will often go to great lengths to do so. It tackles the hard but honest truth about the realities of childhood sexual abuse and chronic illness, but doesn't end there. Joyce focuses on the God of redemption, healing, and love. This is an honest portrayal of what happens when we truly open our hearts to Jesus and allow Him to speak truth and healing into our pain. The journey is intense and spiritually and physically exhausting, but the divine destination to Joyce&#x2019;s healed heart is a glorious testimony to God&#x2019;s ability to transform lives. It will inspire you to a deeper faith in God and in His ability to heal all wounds past and present. � Discover how trials DO have a higher purpose in our lives � Learn about the long-term effects of sexual abuse, but also that healing IS possible! � Understand how wrestling with God over your doubts and anger CAN actually lead to a deeper faith.</p><p>Joyce Ritchie lives in the country with her husband, two dogs, and an empty nest. Her life perfectly demonstrates that we never know where God will take us. After years of studying for a medical career, she never dreamed she would find herself retired at such an early age. A private and introspective person by nature, she is even more astonished to have penned such an open and vulnerable memoir. She enjoys daily learning more about Jesus and about what walking with Him entails.</p><h2>Wanderlust</h2><p><p>Drawing together many histories&#x2014;of anatomical evolution and city design, of treadmills and labyrinths, of walking clubs and sexual mores&#x2014;Rebecca Solnit creates a fascinating portrait of the range of possibilities presented by walking. Arguing that the history of walking includes walking for pleasure as well as for political, aesthetic, and social meaning, Solnit focuses on the walkers whose everyday and extreme acts have shaped our culture, from philosophers to poets to mountaineers. She profiles some of the most significant walkers in history and fiction&#x2014;from Wordsworth to Gary Snyder, from Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet to Andre Breton's Nadja&#x2014;finding a profound relationship between walking and thinking and walking and culture. Solnit argues for the necessity of preserving the time and space in which to walk in our ever more car-dependent and accelerated world.</p></p><p>The ability to walk on two legs over long distances distinguishes <i>Homo sapiens</i> from other primates, and indeed from every other species on earth. That ability has also yielded some of the best creative work of our species: the lyrical ballads of the English romantic poets, composed on long walks over hill and dale; the speculations of the peripatetic philosophers; the meditations of footloose Chinese and Japanese poets; the exhortations of Henry David Thoreau and Walt Whitman.<p> Rebecca Solnit, a thoughtful writer and spirited walker, takes her readers on a leisurely journey through the prehistory, history, and natural history of bipedal motion. Walking, she observes, affords its practitioners an immediate reward--the ability to observe the world at a relaxed gait, one that allows us to take in sights, sounds, and smells that we might otherwise pass by. It provides a vehicle for much-needed solitude and private thought. For the health-minded, walking affords a low-impact and usually pleasant way of shedding a few pounds and stretching a few muscles. It is an essential part of the human adventure--and one that has, until now, been too little documented.</p><p> Written in a time when landscapes and cities alike are designed to accommodate automobiles and not pedestrians, Solnit's extraordinary book is an enticement to lace up shoes and set out on an aimless, meditative stroll of one's own. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Writer, historian, and activist Rebecca Solnit is the author of sixteen books about civil society, popular power, uprisings, art, environment, place, pleasure, politics, hope, and memory.

B�os-his first book to be translated into English-builds on two decades of highly regarded thought, including his thesis that the modern individual-with all of its civil and political rights as well as its moral powers-is an attempt to attain immunity from the contagion of the extraindividual, namely, the community. </p><p>In B�os, Esposito applies such a paradigm of immunization to the analysis of the radical transformation of the political into biopolitics. B�os discusses the origins and meanings of biopolitical discourse, demonstrates why none of the categories of modern political thought is useful for completely grasping the essence of biopolitics, and reconstructs the negative biopolitical core of Nazism. Esposito suggests that the best contemporary response to the current deadly version of biopolitics is to understand what could make up the elements of a positive biopolitics-a politics of life rather than a politics of mastery and negation of life.</p><p>In his introduction, Timothy Campbell situates Esposito&#x2019;s arguments within American and European thinking on biopolitics. A comprehensive, illuminating, and highly original treatment of a critically important topic, B�os introduces an English-reading public to a philosophy that will critically impact such wide-ranging current debates as stem cell research, euthanasia, and the war on terrorism.</p><p>Roberto Esposito teaches contemporary philosophy at the Italian Institute for the Human Sciences in Naples. His books include Categorie dell impolitico, Nove pensieri sulla politica, Communitas: orgine e destino della comunit�, and Immunitas: protezione e negazione della vita.</p><p>Timothy Campbell is associate professor of Italian studies in the Department of Romance Studies at Cornell University and the author of Wireless Writing in the Age of Marconi (Minnesota, 2006).</p></p><p></p><h2>The Spiritual Society: What Lurks Beyond Postmodernism?</h2><p>In recent decades, American Christians have been subjected to a series of different worldviews, all of them hostile to biblical faith. And there are clear signs that a cultural shift is again taking place, bringing in a system that is religious in outlook, though by no means Christian. Frederic Baue describes this newly emerging worldview and recommends an appropriate response for the church. Applying insights from great thinkers and carefully observing cultural shifts, he presents a glimpse of the future to help prepare God&#39;s people for the challenges that are to come.</p><p></p><h2>The Magic School Bus: Gets A Bright Idea, The: A Book About Light</h2><p>Ms. Frizzle&#39;s class thinks the PTA light show is pretty wild, but really surprising things happen when Ms. Frizzle and the Magic School Bus arrive to teach about the properties of light.

Medieval robots took such forms as talking statues, mechanical animals, and silent metal guardians; some served to entertain or instruct while others performed disciplinary or surveillance functions. Variously ascribed to artisanal genius, inexplicable cosmic forces, or demonic powers, these marvelous fabrications raised fundamental questions about knowledge, nature, and divine purpose in the Middle Ages.</p><p><i>Medieval Robots</i> recovers the forgotten history of fantastical, aspirational, and terrifying machines that captivated Europe in imagination and reality between the ninth and fourteenth centuries. E. R. Truitt traces the different forms of self-moving or self-sustaining manufactured objects from their earliest appearances in the Latin West through centuries of mechanical and literary invention. Chronicled in romances and song as well as histories and encyclopedias, medieval automata were powerful cultural objects that probed the limits of natural philosophy, illuminated and challenged definitions of life and death, and epitomized the transformative and threatening potential of foreign knowledge and culture. This original and wide-ranging study reveals the convergence of science, technology, and imagination in medieval culture and demonstrates the striking similarities between medieval and modern robotic and cybernetic visions.</p></p><p>E. R. Truitt is Associate Professor of History at Bryn Mawr College.<p>"Engagingly written and thoughtfully researched, <i>Medieval Robots</i> will be of value to specialists in the intellectual and literary history of the Middle Ages, as well as to more general readers. . . . Truitt's suggestive and nuanced account both firmly establishes the importance of medieval automata in the wider development of Western thought about the relationship of science, technology, and the imagination and opens the door to further research."&#x2014;<i>American Historical Review</i></p><br><br><p>"The first comprehensive work of scholarship on European automata of the Middle Ages, <i>Medieval Robots</i> systematically and chronologically works through themes such as the transition from the magical to the mechanical and the liminal status of robots between art and nature, familiar and foreign. Well researched and well written, the book does an excellent job of showing the wider cultural significance of automata within medieval history and the history of science."&#x2014;Pamela O. Long, author of <i>Openness, Secrecy, Authorship: Technical Arts and the Culture of Knowledge from Antiquity to the Renaissance</i></p><br><br><p>"<i>Medieval Robots</i> is not only a remarkably evocative book, but it also breaks new ground by virtue of being the first survey of its kind in the English-speaking academic world, relocating our discussion of the legacy of ancient automata to novel chronological coordinates. It is reasonable to hope that Truitt's book will lead to a reconsideration of 'Abbasid patronage of science, magical hermetism, and the nexus of technology and ethnography, among many other themes, not to mention to our understanding of the Middle Ages itself."&#x2014;<i>Reviews in History</i></p></p><h2>Surfing for Secrets (Geronimo Stilton Cavemice #8) (8)</h2><p>Geronimo Stilton's ancient ancestor is back in another prehistoric adventure!<br><br>A mysterious rodent has been shipwrecked on Mouse Island.

In 1965, Greene joined journalist Bernard Diederich in the Dominican Republic to embark on a tour of its border with Haiti, then ruled by "Papa Doc" Duvalier. They were accompanied by activist priest Jean-Claude Bajeux. Diederich had known Greene since the mid-1950s and had lived in Haiti for 14 years. He was a seasoned correspondent for the British and North American press and had reported many stories from the region, including Castro's triumph in Cuba and the death of the Dominican dictator, Trujillo. In 1963, he had been thrown out of Haiti and when Greene arrived was working from the Dominican Republic. The famous novelist was 61 and depressed, having struggled to finish <i>A Burnt-Out Case</i>, and was being plagued by religious doubt; Bajeux, meanwhile, had been informed that his family had been "disappeared" by Duvalier's henchmen. As this trio traveled along the border they met a number of rebels and other characters later fictionalized in Greene's most politically charged novel, <i>The Comedians</i>, published the following year.&nbsp;This book tells the story of how a series of extraordinary and often hair-raising journeys gave one of the greatest novelists of the 20th century new inspiration in his writing.</p></p><p><b>Bernard Diederich</b> is a journalist, originally from New Zealand, who launched&nbsp;the English-language weekly newspaper the <i>Haiti Sun</i> in 1950, and subsequently became the resident correspondent for the Associated Press, the <i>New York Times</i>, the Time-Life News Service, and London's <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. In 1963, as a result of his courageous reporting, Diederich was arrested by Papa Doc's Tontons-Makouts, imprisoned, and ultimately expelled from the country. In exile in the Dominican Republic, he&nbsp;was staff foreign correspondent for the Time-Life News service. <b>Richard Greene</b> is an associate professor at the University of Toronto and the editor of <i>Graham Greene: A Life in Letters</i>. He lives in Cobourg, Ontario. <b>Pico Iyer</b> is an essayist and novelist whose books include<i> The Man Within My Head</i> and<i> The Open Road</i>. He writes for such publications as <i>Harper's</i>, <i>New York&nbsp;Review of Books</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Time</i>."This is a perfect match of subject and author.

Through an innovative rereading of the Puritan sources, Alfred A. Cave refutes claims that settlers acted defensively to counter a Pequot conspiracy to exterminate Europeans. Drawing on archaeological, linguistic, and anthropological evidences to trace the evolution of the conflict, he sheds new light on the motivations of the Pequots and their Indian allies. He also provides a reappraisal of the interaction of ideology and self- interest as motivating factors in the Puritan attack on the Pequots.</p><p>Alfred A.

That Sweden achieved this was due to its leadership&#x2014;a case-study in history when pure military skill, and that alone, could override the demographic and economic factors which have in modern times been termed so pre-eminent.<br><br>Once Protestantism emerged, via Martin Luther, the most devastating war in European history ensued, as the Holy Roman Empire sought to reassert its authority by force. Into this bloody maelstrom stepped Gustav Adolf of Sweden, a brilliant tactician and strategist, who with his finely honed Swedish legions proceeded to establish a new authority in northern Europe. Gustav, as brave as he was brilliant, was finally killed while leading a cavalry charge at the Battle of L�tzen.<br><br>He had innovated, however, tactics and weaponry that put his successors in good stead, as Sweden remained a great power, rivaled only by France and Spain in terms of territory in Europe. <br><br>And then one of his successors, Karl XII, turned out to be just as great a military genius as Gustav himself, and as the year 1700 arrived, Swedish armies once more burst out in all directions. Karl, like Gustav, assumed the throne while still a teenager, but immediately displayed so much acumen, daring and skill that chroniclers could only compare him, like Gustav, to Alexander the Great.<br><br>This book examines thoroughly, yet in highly readable fashion, the century during which Swedish military power set an example for all Europe. While the Continent was most visibly divided along religious lines&#x2014;Catholic versus Protestant&#x2014;geopolitical motives always underlied the conflicts. Sweden&#x2019;s reliance on its military skill was especially noteworthy, as it veritably founded the modern concept of making wars pay through conquest.<br><br>Karl XII finally let his ambitions lead him too far, as did Napoleon and Hitler in following centuries, into the vastness of the nascent Russian Empire, where he was finally defeated, at Poltava in Ukraine. Thus the period of Swedish supremacy in Europe came to a close, albeit not without leaving important lessons behind. In this work, by renowned author Henrik O. Lunde, these are clearly to be seen.<br><br>About the author:<br><br>HENRIK O. LUNDE, born in Norway, moved to America as a child and thence rose in the U.S. Army to become a Colonel in Special Forces. Highly decorated for bravery in Vietnam, he proceeded to gain advance degrees and assume strategic posts, his last being in the Plans and Policy Branch of Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe.<br><br>After retirement from the Army he turned to writing, with a focus on his native North, and given his combination of personal tactical knowledge plus objective strategic grasp has authored several groundbreaking works. These include Hitler&#x2019;s Pre-Emptive War, about Norway 1940, Finland&#x2019;s War of Choice, and Hitler&#x2019;s Wave-Breaking Concept, which analyzes the controversial retreat of Germany&#x2019;s Army Group North from the Leningrad front in WWII.<br><br>In A Warrior Dynasty he reexamines the potential of pure military skill in global affairs.

In 1938, he joined the four-masted Finnish barque Moshulu as an apprentice and sailed in the last Grain Race from Australia to Europe, by way of Cape Horn. During World War II, he served in the Black Watch and the Special Boat Section. In 1942, he was captured and remained a prisoner-of-war until 1945. He subsequently married the girl who helped him to escape, and for the next fifty years, his wife Wanda was at his side on many adventures. After the war, he worked in the fashion business and book publishing but always travelled on a grand scale, sometimes as the Travel Editor for the Observer. He was made CBE in 1994 and was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award of the British Guild of Travel Writers in 2001. Eric Newby died in 2006.Touring Ireland by bicycle in the winter is a daunting prospect even for the most seasoned backpackers, but Newby and his wife Wanda weathered it with good humor and resilience. The author of such classics of travel literature as A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush and Slowly Down the Ganges takes the armchair traveler with him as he and his companion contend with misleading signposts, lonely roads, torrential rain, gale-force winds and unhelpful natives who describe any destination as "up the road a bit" although it may be circular miles away. As a result, the Newbys fall upon many culturally significant points by absolute chance. Trips to remote castles, holy wells and splendid ruins in the west of Ireland are enlivened by lashings of Guinness and tea, and by the often antic behavior of the locals met in omnipresent pubs. The Newbys, who live in England, returned to Ireland in the summer, when travelers are more expansively welcomed and more places are open, but it is their winter tour that captures the essence of the country and its delightfully idiosyncratic populace.

She endured a catastrophic set of physical calamities as a child and young woman, was an active member of the Communist Party, and survived a tempestuous marriage to the artist Diego Rivera. This book includes many photographs of her life alongside her extraordinary paintings, and presents commentary by leading Mexican art historians, stunning reproductions of her most seminal works -- some never before reproduced, and nine gate-folds allowing the reader to examine in detail aspects of her larger works.</p><p>In his beautifully illustrated survey of Frida Kahlo's work, Lozano (art history, Iberoamerican Univ., Mexico City) explores her life and paintings in a series of essays that range from a poetic study by noted Mexican cultural critic Carlos Monsiv is to a short, prosaic piece written in 1943 by her husband, Diego Rivera, to an academic essay by Lozano himself. The common thread is how Kahlo's pre-Columbian background helped her find her own identity in the world and in the artist circles she frequented. To create a portrait of a woman so talented yet so tortured, Lozano uses Kahlo's own stunning images, offering high-quality reproductions of some of Kahlo's most famous works as well as some of her lesser-known pieces. Previously unseen photos of Kahlo at work in her studio are also included. The detail and clarity of the images is incredible, allowing the reader to explore each painting thoroughly.

During these years, Marxists in both Russia and Germany found their economic ideas inextricably linked with practical political problems, and treated theory as a guide to action. This book systematically examines the important theoretical literature of the period, including insightful works by political functionaries outside academia--journalists, party organizers, underground activists, and teachers in the labor movement--presented here as the primary forgers of Marxian economic thought.</p><p>Beginning with Engels's writings, this book analyzes the work of leading Marxist economists in the Second International, then concludes with a review of the intellectual movements within the Marxian political economy during the 1920s.

What to do? There is no 911 for pets, so it's up to you to save a life. <i>The First Aid Companion for Dogs &amp; Cats</i> is a straightforward guide that covers both major problems--CPR, heat stroke, and strangulation--and minor ones, such as swollen tails, ingrown nails, and flea allergies. Beginning with simple tests and explanations of general care issues like dehydration examinations and triage, this guide then moves on to an alphabetical listing of every possible situation, from arrow wounds to worms. <p> The individual sections are good for both general reading and instant assistance. Each one starts with a notice of when to call the vet--immediately, the same day, or as needed. It also lists what items from your pet's medicine chest will be needed, which may include anything from corn syrup to towels and panty hose. The information that follows this simple checklist is divided into "do this now," "special situations," "follow-up care," and "the best approach." Whenever necessary, simple sketches are included to help show proper technique, such as fashioning an instant muzzle from a pair of nylons, or how to cover a dog's head in case of an ear-flap injury. Relying frequently on common household items like antihistamines, turkey basters, Gatorade, and plastic wrap, this guide assumes most of us won't have special medical training or supplies and focuses on very specific and simple methods of helping your pet achieve the best possible care.

Philip Yancey&#39;s What&#39;s So Amazing About Grace? won the Book of the Year Award in 1998 and has sold over one million copies since it was first published in 1997. Now this innovative visual edition uses the life-transforming content of Yancey&#39;s message and makes it accessible to a whole new audience. This visually rich book takes portions of the text of the original book and illustrates the themes and messages with provocative full-color photography and graphic illustrations. The creators of this visual edition designed it with the needs of contemporary postmodern readers in mind: both spiritual seekers and the younger, more visually oriented readers of today&#39;s culture. By combining Yancey&#39;s engaging style with striking images that enhance and illuminate the message, this unique book enables readers to &#39;experience grace&#39; as they interact with the powerfully imaginative format. With deep personal honesty Yancey paints true portraits of grace&#39;s life-changing power as he searches for its presence in his own life and the life of the church. He explores grace---God&#39;s love for the undeserving---while challenging Christians to become living answers to a world that desperately wants to know: What&#39;s so amazing about grace?</p><p>Mention the word "grace" and what immediately comes to mind for most of us is a bagpipe wailing the solemn notes of "Amazing Grace." <p> The grace of which Philip Yancey writes is the freely given and unmerited favor and love of God. This grace seems a remote, almost sentimental concept, without a place in our lives or our society. It is a vague, slippery thing to us, probably because we seem to experience grace so rarely and have managed to leech the word of meaning. But Philip Yancey has set about to rescue grace in his book <i>What's So Amazing About Grace?</i> </p><p> This grace is the true message of Jesus. All faiths have virtues and creeds and justice and truth, but Jesus speaks merely of receiving the love that God has for us. Accepting it, not earning it or making ourselves worthy of it. And frankly, accepting something we have not earned or are not worthy of is not an easy thing for most of us. </p><p> In truth, grace is both utterly simple and utterly confounding. Little by little, Yancey guides us into a clearer understanding of grace by using stories, in much the same way Jesus did. We read stories of both grace and ungrace at work in people's lives. Sadly, it is stories of ungrace that are more prevalent today, the current culture wars painful acknowledgments of ungrace in our lives as Christians in this country. Yancey helps us understand that ungrace is that state of being in which self-righteousness and pride are a result of thinking that we have somehow earned God's approval and may now stand in judgment in his behalf. </p><p> Philip Yancey was awarded the Gold Medallion Christian Book of the Year award for this book in 1998 by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association. Readers concurred with this decision, making this book an immediate bestseller. Believers and nonbelievers alike should accept Yancey's challenge to become agents of grace rather than agents of vengeance or judgment or anger. In truth, we are each starving for grace, ready to grasp it tightly. And it is through grace that all other hungers--for justice, for righteousness, for love--are satisfied. Yancey opens his book by telling us that "grace" is the last best word, and in <i>What's So Amazing About Grace?</i>, he proves that he's right. <i>--Patricia Klein</i></p>The Jesus I Never Knew and What&#39;s So Amazing About Grace? have influenced the Christian church in a way few other books ever have. Both have ascended to the ranks of ongoing best-sellers. Both have won the Gold Medallion Book of the Year Award--fitting recognition for what may well be Philip Yancey&#39;s two most significant books to date. And now the previously abridged audio editions of these two remarkable works come unabridged. Read by professional narrator Bill Richards, here are Yancey&#39;s complete, passionate, personal insights into the person of Jesus and the nature of grace--with the convenience and flexibility of Zondervan Audio Pages.</p><h2>Blackhawks Vol. 1: The Great Leap Forward (The New 52)</h2><p>As a part of DC Comics - The New 52 event of September 2011, welcome to a world waging a new kind of war that's faster and more brutal than ever before.

During the 37 months that made up his personal war, this young Marine fought both the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese in the mountains, jungles, rice paddies and valleys of South Vietnam. Relying on the training of his childhood as a Lumbee Indian, it did not take him long to learn to track his enemy in the woods and fields they called home. He also came to respect and learn from his enemy. Told simply and courageously, Moon Dash Warrior, is, in the end, the starkly real and very moving account of the difficult but honorable trail one proud, young, American Indian warrior determined to follow to its end.</p><p>Delano served three tours in Vietnam, one with the infantry and two with recon.

Between 1871 and 1919, the population of Berlin quadrupled,<br>and the city became the political center of Germany, as well as the turbulent crossroads of the modern age. This was reflected in the work of artists, directors, writers, and critics of the time. As an imperial capital, Berlin was the site of violent political revolution and radical aesthetic innovation. After the German<br>defeat in World War I, artists employed collage to challenge<br>traditional concepts of art. Berlin Dadaists reflected upon<br>the horrors of war, and the terrors of revolution and civil war.<br>Between 1924 and 1929 as the spirit of modernity took hold,<br>jazz, posters, magazines, advertisements, and cinema played<br>a central role in the development of Berlin&#x2019;s urban experience.<br>The concept of the &#x201c;Neue Frau&#x201d;&#x2015;the modern, emancipated<br>woman&#x2013;helped move the city in a new direction. Finally, Berlin<br>became a stage for political confrontation between the left<br>and the right and was deeply affected by the economic crisis<br>and mass unemployment at the end of the 1920s. This book<br>explores in numerous essays and illustrations the artistic,<br>cultural, and social upheavals in Berlin between 1918 and 1933,<br>and places them in a broader historical framework.</p><p>Olaf Peters is Professor of Modern Art at the Martin Luther University in Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.</p><h2>Michel Foucault</h2><p><p> At the time of his death in 1984, at the age of fifty-eight, Michel Foucault was widely regarded as one of the most powerful minds of this century. Hailed by distinguished historians and lionized on his frequent visits to America, he continues to provoke lively debate. The nature and merits of his accomplishments remain tangled in controversy. Rejecting traditional liberal and Marxist "dreams of solidarity," Foucault became the very model of the modern intellectual, replacing Sartre as the figure of the eminent Parisian and cosmopolitan master thinker. </p><p> Foucault himself discouraged biographical questions, claiming that he was "not at all interesting." Didier Eribon's captivating account overthrows that assertion. As a journalist well acquainted with Foucault for years before his death, Eribon was particularly well placed to conduct the dozens of interviews which are the cornerstone of this book. He has drawn upon eyewitness accounts by Foucault's closest associates from all phases of his life--his mother, his schoolteachers, his classmates, his friends and enemies in academic life, and his celebrated companions in political activism, including Simone Signoret and Yves Montand. Eribon has methodically retraced the footsteps of his peripatetic subject, from France to Sweden to Poland to Germany to Tunisia to Brazil to Japan to the United States. The result is a concise, crisply readable, meticulously documented narrative that debunks the many myths and rumors surrounding the brilliant philosophe--and forces us to consider seriously the idea that all his books are indeed, just as Foucault said near the end of his life, "fragments of an autobiography." </p><p> Who was this man, Michel Foucault? In the late 1950s Foucault emerged as a budding young cultural attach�, friendly with Gaullist diplomats. By the mid-1960s he appeared as one of the avatars of structuralism, positioning himself as a new star in the fashionable world of French thought. A few months after the May 1968 student revolt, with Gaullism apparently shaken, he emerged as an ultra-leftist and a fellow traveler of Maoists. Yet during this same period, Eribon shows, he was quietly and adroitly campaigning for a chair in the College de France--the very pinnacle of the French academic system. This book does more than follow the career of one extraordinary intellectual. It reconstructs the cultural, political, and intellectual life of France from the postwar years to the present. It is the story of a man and his time. </p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchA meticulous and authoritative biography of the influential French philosopher and historian, by an editor at Le Nouvel Observateur who was closely acquainted with Foucault during his later years. Foucault (1926-84) is known in this country mainly as one of the prime exemplars of structuralism, the radical school of thought developed in the late 60's and 70's to question the foundations of many social and philosophical systems. In reality, as Eribon makes clear, Foucault was more of an intellectual historian than a philosopher, and achieved his greatest successes when attempting to set forth the ``archaeology'' of a concept or idea. This is what he did in Madness and Civilization, which traced the development of Western notions of sanity and reason as reflected in social attitudes towards madness. His monumental History of Sexuality, left unfinished at his death, was to provide a similar blueprint for the modern understanding of eroticism. Eribon's exposition is readable and clear, and makes good use of the many interviews he held with Foucault during his lifetime, as well as his meetings with Foucault's colleagues and friends. The picture that emerges is of someone at once distant and complex: Foucault hated easy characterizations and refused to ``take sides'' when it came to politics or philosophy. His early dalliance with Marxism quickly gave way in the late 50's, and his later conservatism evaporated as soon as he won his post at the College de France (where, during the 70's and 80's, he became known as one of the most active leftists in the country). Solitary and rather reclusive despite his wide circle of friends, Foucault's public life was largely restricted to his professional writings, and it is to Eribon's credit that he concentrates mainly on these, since they provide the truest picture of Foucault available. Superbly written and carefully documented: Eribon has managed to provide a scholarly exegesis of Foucault that will also serve as a good introduction for the lay reader. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His glory days were in the 1920s, when he coached Jesus College, Cambridge and Thames and London Rowing Clubs to an extraordinary succession of regatta victories. Wherever they went, Faribairn&#39;s disciples lifted standards of performance to undreamed of heights. After Steve died, his son Ian collected his father&#39;s writings, which had first been published in five separate books, into a single volume which he called Steve Fairbairn on Rowing. This was published in 1951 and has long been out of print. This new edition, which carries an introduction by Geoffrey page of the Daily Telegraph, himself a great admirer of Steve Fairbairn&#39;s methods, will meet a long felt need for one of the great classics of rowing literature.</p><p></p><h2>Rrose Is a Rrose Is a Rrose: Gender Performance in Photography</h2><p>Films with cross-dressed protagonists and advertisements featuring androgynous adolescents are just some of the evidence of the contemporary fascination with gender and sexuality. This book provides an art-historical perspective on photography that explores and plays with this controversial, sexy subject. 144 color photos.</p><p>The title of this large, provocative book is a combination of two historical wordplays: Gertrude Stein's famous "Rose is a rose is a rose," and Marcel Duchamp's "Rrose Selavy," the name of his imaginary, female alter ego. Spoken, it sounds like "Eros, c'est la vie,"or "Eros, that's life." <p> The catalog of an exhibition at New York's Guggenheim Museum, <i> Rrose is a Rrose is a Rrose</i> is exquisitely, elegantly designed. It includes a wealth of pictures as well as six essays on issues such as surrealist ambiguity, the exhibitionist body art of the 1970s, "queer theory" and "queer reality," and the fluidity of gender identity. With the exception of some 20th-century images of rubber appendages or bound dolls, much of the material has an innocent charm. In one of Alice Austen's Victorian-era self-portraits, for example, she and two friends are dressed as men, with spats, hats, and fake moustaches. One has carefully balanced a walking stick to suggest a male member; the women are cracking up. </p><p> The volume also explores the prejudice surrounding the evolution of gender consciousness, and details the heroism of many artists devoted to tolerance, such as Claude Cahun, whom the Nazis sentenced to death. <i>Rrose is a Rrose is a Rrose</i> will not change minds, but it will broaden those already open to its subject.</p></p><h2>Big Twitch: One Man, One Continent, a Race Against Time&#x2015;A True Story about Birdwatching</h2><p>As a self-proclaimed twitcher&#x2014;a birdwatching extremist who travels around the country trying to catch a glimpse of as many species of birds as possible&#x2014;the author took&nbsp;a year off in 2002 with the goal of seeing 700 birds and thereby breaking the national record for most birds seen in one year. In this amusing memoir, he recounts his quest, including how he spent all of his inheritance from the untimely death of his parents to make his dream a reality. Populated by unusual characters and interesting species of birds, this part confessional&#x2013;part travelogue for both bird nerds and the general population follows the author as he works out what it means to be normal despite his unusually avid compulsion toward twitching.<br></p><p><b>Sean Dooley</b> is a comedy writer for television. He has worked as a stand-up comedian and has performed a one-man show about birdwatching.<br>Dooley makes his living in Australia writing television comedy scripts, but his real passion is bird-watching&#x2014;in fact, he'll frequently "twitch," dropping whatever he's doing to travel hundreds of miles for a brief glimpse of a recently sighted rare species. In 2002, he set out to break the record for the most birds spotted throughout the Australian territories in a single year. The effort to track down more than 700 species takes him from a sooty owl sitting on a tree branch in the early hours of New Year's Day to a blue-faced parrot finch climbing a blade of grass on Christmas Eve. Stories about frustrated efforts to spot various birds show a winning humor, but without any pictures of birds or their habitats, all the locations start to blur together. The amiable, conversational tone keeps the story from getting dull, and the Aussie cultural references are easily deciphered, but Dooley's accomplishment in the end feels anticlimactic. <i>(Aug. )</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Richard Surman has toured the ecclesiastical sites of Britain photographing cats in abbeys, priories, churches and minsters. For this book he has focused on the larger, close-up portraits of cats, making it a sumptuous coffee table book, with plenty of lovable characters. Each of the 20 chapters begins with a line drawing of the church, followed by 2 or 3 photographs of the cats that live there. Richard Surman tells their stories with sensitive and often humorous commentary.</p><p>This book, and a companion volume &#34;Cathedral Cats&#34; (ISBN: 0006280714), form a group portrait of some of the most privileged cats in Britain. Their homes could not be more ancient or more splendid. They are admired by thousands of tourists. There is hardly a door or a window that is closed to them. They have the run of roofs and vaults, nooks and crannies, cloisters and choirs. Photographer Richard Surman has traveled to dozens of Britain&#39;s great churches and cathedrals to record these ecclesiastical felines, and each photo is accompanied by a pen portrait of the cat and its particular eccentricities. There is Biggles, for example, feline tyrant of Westminster Abbey, who was issued an official warning by the police after mauling a constable&#39;s trousers!

There are no plot surprises; the authors have retained the basic story of an alien four-year-old child who is kidnapped from his time zone and brought into a future world. Yet this is a fresh and satisfying version, primarily because the characters have been made richer, the depiction of 21st-century society rounded out and the history of the Neanderthal tribe from which the eponymous boy was abducted more fully given. When the woebegone waif, now named Timmie, was snatched from his epoch, he was brought into a pool of no-time, which exists coincident with the present. Since Timmie is condemned to living within that pool forever, his presence raises moral questions: Is it abusive to leave him alone in this limbo for eternity? Would it be equally cruel to send him back to the Ice Age? Asimov ( Foundation ) and Silverberg ( Lord Valentine's Castle ) explore these issues in an intriguing story supported by seamless writing. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000</h2><p><p><b>Suspense, politics, war, humor and intergalactic finance.</b> A towering masterwork of science fiction adventure and one of the best-selling science fiction novels of all time, L.

A young nobleman, falsely accused of shouting republican slogans, was savagely tortured for hours by a mob of peasants who later burned him alive. Rumors of cannibalism stirred public fascination, and the details of the case were dramatically recounted in the popular press. While the crime was rife with political significance, the official inquiry focused on its brutality. Justice was swift: the mob&#x2019;s alleged ringleaders were guillotined at the scene of the crime the following winter.</p><p><i>The Village of Cannibals</i> is a fascinating inquiry by historian Alain Corbin into the social and political ingredients of an alchemy that transformed ordinary people into executioners in nineteenth-century France. Corbin&#x2019;s chronicle of the killing is significant for the new light it sheds on the final eruption of peasant rage in France to end in murder. No other author has investigated this harrowing event in such depth or brought to its study such a wealth of perspectives.</p><p>Corbin explores incidents of public violence during and after the French Revolution and illustrates how earlier episodes in France&#x2019;s history provide insight into the mob&#x2019;s methods and choice of victim. He describes in detail the peasants&#x2019; perception of the political landscape and the climate of fear that fueled their anxiety and ignited long-smoldering hatreds. Drawing on the minutes of court proceedings, accounts of contemporary journalists, and testimony of eyewitnesses, the author offers a precise chronology of the chain of events that unfolded on the fairground that summer afternoon. His detailed investigation into the murder at Hautefaye reveals the political motivations of the murderers and the gulf between their actions and the sensibilities of the majority of French citizens, who no longer tolerated violence as a viable form of political expression. The book will be welcomed by scholars, students, and general readers for its compelling insights into the nature of collective violence.</p></p><p>Corbin explores incidents of public violence during and after the French Revolution and illustrates how earlier episodes in France&#39;s history provide insight into the mob&#39;s methods and choice of victim.<p>Alain Corbin is Professor of History, Emeritus, at the University of Paris 1 Panth�on-Sorbonne.</p></p><h2>Terror and Joy: The Films of Dusan Makavejev</h2><p>Matching the intensity of the films, Lorraine Mortimer takes a radically interdisciplinary approach in this first book-length critical analysis of Makavejev&#39;s work.</p><p>Du&#x161;an Makavejev is a filmmaker, teacher, and intellectual whose films intersect with major historical and political upheavals in Eastern Europe&#x2014;World War II, the unification and breakup of Yugoslavia, and the fall of communism. Subversive and moving, his films remain touchstones for transcultural and political cinema. Matching the intensity of the films, Lorraine Mortimer takes a radically interdisciplinary approach in this first book-length critical analysis of Makavejev&#x2019;s work. <br><br>Studies in contrasts, Makavejev&#x2019;s films combine documentary and fiction, tragedy and comedy. Mortimer examines seven of his films made between 1965 and 1994&#x2014;including Montenegro (1981), Sweet Movie (1974), and WR: Mysteries of the Organism (1971)&#x2014;looking at them historically, politically, and aesthetically and highlighting their implications for the contemporary world.<br><br>Both Makavejev&#x2019;s films and Mortimer&#x2019;s scrutiny of them are haunted by the specter of apocalyptic revolutionary movements that sacrifice people and the planet in the name of ideologies and idealisms. Mortimer argues that the aesthetic dimension is vital to our conception of old and new tribalisms and, ultimately, our understanding of being in the world.</p><h2>The doctor&#39;s sweetheart and other stories</h2><p>In this remarkable collection of fourteen&nbsp;&nbsp;previously uncollected stories, L.M.

Initially, Lieutenant Austin Henely was viewed as a hero, and his H Company men were awarded eight Medals of Honor for their bravery in the skirmish. However, later intimations surfaced that the Sappa Creek fight was a massacre of the Cheyennes under Little Bull who attempted to surrender. Tales of innocent noncombatants being murdered in the destruction of the camp following the battle were common by the early twentieth century. </p><p>Avoiding the current approach of separating the participants into clear camps of victims and victimizers, Monnett instead uses the Sappa Creek battle as a case study to understand how Americans since 1875 have perceived the Indian wars in general within the larger cultural construct. By studying the Sappa Creek Massacre and its remaining mysteries from this perspective, Monnett reveals as much about how Americans view Western history and the theme of manifest destiny as he does about what we can accurately conclude from the facts of the battle. </p><p>Massacre at Cheyenne Hole is a welcome addition to the literature about the Indian wars and the Cheyenne Indians, and will appeal to both historians and the general reader interested in military and Native American history.</p></p><p>A native of Kansas City, John H. Monnett is the author of the award-winning The Battle of Beecher Island and the Indian War of 18671869 and Colorado Profiles (University Press of Colorado) as well as three other books on the history of the American West. Dr. Monnett teaches Western and Colorado history at Metropolitan State College in Denver.

West Coast Seafood addresses the finfish and shellfish, ocean and fresh water catch available fresh from California to Alaska, with over 250 recipes, both basic and lavish. <p> This important new cookbook introduces the up-to-the-minute selection of fresh fish and shellfish available on the West Coast and furnishes 250 wonderful recipes that bring out the most in albacore, spot prawns, black cod, salmon, rainbow trout, petrale sole, skate, oysters, and more. It includes color photographs.</p></p><p>Picture yourself standing before the fish monger's display case with the day's catch all nicely laid out on gleaming shaved ice, the price tags and labels in place, the fishmonger's retail smile intact. He's waiting, patiently, for you to make up your mind. Trouble is, you're shopping for a specific fish, and it's not for sale. So what do you do, fall back on old tried-and-true recipes for the seafood you recognize in the case? You can hear your family yawning, can't you?<p> Fear not, lover of seafood. Jay Harlow has written <i>West Coast Seafood: The Complete Cookbook</i>. Tuck this sucker under your arm next time you head out the door and you will never again suffer seafood angst. Nor will you have to stand in front of the fish counter thumbing through a book like a damned fool. Harlow, you see, has organized <i>West Coast Seafood</i> by type of seafood, not according to where in a meal the dish will be served. </p><p> And if that doesn't tell you that this guy knows what he's doing, then just dig in. <i>Complete Cookbook</i> falls short of the mark; <i>Final Word</i> comes closer. Because everything <i>is</i> here: all the information you need to select the best-quality seafood; instructions to clean and prep the seafood you bring home; and then a wide flavor range and cooking-style range to keep new and exciting dishes coming to the dinner table. </p><p> The finned fish of fresh and salt water, both wild and farmed, are all here. Can't stand the idea of another grilled salmon steak? Try Kurt's Salmon with Oyster Stuffing. And if there are any leftovers, go straight to Salmon Cakes. How does Grilled Halibut with Roasted Garlic Marinade sound? Or Halibut Cooked with Poblano Chiles and Cream? Yes, there are Dungeness Crab Cakes in <i>West Coast Seafood</i>, but you will also find Stir-Fried Crab with Chiles and Ginger.</p><p> There are no desserts. But Harlow does end his book with a selection of appropriate sauces as well as two essays on the future of fishing, and the place of aquaculture. Like the entire book, well worth reading. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Want to know how to approach seafood with confidence - both in the market and in the kitchen? At long last, here's a trustworthy, up-to-the-minute cook's guide to fresh seafood, "West Coast style." <p> Much of the nation's seafood supply comes from the West Coast, according to Jay Harlow, author of West Coast Seafood: The Complete Cookbook. In his definitive new cookbook, Harlow, a veteran seafood chef, cookbook author, cooking teacher and all-around seafood expert based in Berkeley, California' introduces the sometimes bewildering array of fresh fish and shellfish now commonly available to home cooks. The result is a trustworthy, up-to-the-minute cook's guide. </p><p> From familiar varieties such as salmon, halibut, swordfish, and Dungeness crab, to more exotic types like tilapia, wolffish, and grenadier, his complete cookbook provides an impressive collection of information, instruction, and recipes. Whether it is albacore from the Pacific Ocean, California halibut from the Sea of Cortez, king salmon from Alaska's Copper River, or Pacific oysters from the waters of Hood Canal, West Coast Seafood explains what it is, when it's in season, and how to cook it to bring out its best flavors. </p><p> More than 250 delectable recipes, both basic and lavish, run the gamut from West Coast classics such as Angels on Horseback and Crab Louis to contemporary restaurant-style Lemon Scented Pasta with Manila Clams, and Chard Wrapped Salmon Packets. The multicultural array that many Pacific Coast diners enjoy is reflected in dishes such as Catfish in Vietnamese Caramel Sauce; Jerk Fish, a Jamaican-style barbecued halibut; and Chawan-Mushi, a Japanese savory custard with salmon and asparagus. </p><p> Harlow has made it his life's mission to teach home cooks how to approach seafood with confidence, both in the market and in the kitchen. "People are simply not as comfortable preparing seafood as they are other foods," he says. "Most have a limited repertoire of recipes for a few familiar varieties, and are afraid to experiment with others. Harlow's clear, simple, step-by-step instructions and relaxed, confident approach in West Coast Seafood are sure to help cooks cross that bridge, with delicious results. </p><p> West Coast Seafood draws on the nearly two decades Harlow has spent cooking with and writing about seafood. He is author or co-author of 11 cookbooks and writes a seafood column for the San Francisco Examiner. Previously, his weekly column on seafood, "The Fishmonger," ran for more than a decade in the San Francisco Chronicle. </p><p> Before turning to writing, Harlow was a cook and chef at such well know seafood restaurants as the Hayes Street Grill in San Francisco and the Fourth Street Grill and Santa Fe Bar &amp; Grill in Berkeley, working side by side with some of the best of the new breed of California chef/restaurateurs, Jeremiah Tower, Mark Miller, Paul Bertolli, and Patricia Untermann. Since 1983, Harlow has taught cooking classes to home cooks and aspiring chefs throughout the West Coast and across the country. </p><p> "Whether motivated by health concerns or simply looking for more varied and flavorful meals, Americans eat more fish and shellfish than ever before," says Harlow. "At the same time, food retailers across the country have responded to the rising interest with a dramatic increase in the size and selection of their seafood departments." </p><p> "The challenge for the home cook," he adds, "is knowing how best to cook fish that may seem similar but differ widely in flavor. Increased variety means learning about new and unfamiliar species of fish and shellfish, but it also gives the informed cook many more ways to prepare delicious, healthful seafood meals."</p></p><h2>Peake&#39;s Progress</h2><p>Peake&#39;s Progress is a selection, compiled by his widow, Maeve Gilmore, from every period of his work as a writer and draughtsman.

From the strange, Carrollian backwardness of &#x2018;The Weird Journey&#x2019; where the narrator falls &#x2018;fast awake&#x2019; and drifts into a peculiar travelogue, to the splendidly deprecating &#x2018;I Bought a Palm-Tree&#x2019; we hear a writer at the peak of his powers. . . .

The double-page chronologies are broken into columns for each geographic area included within a specific range of dates-for example, "The Ancient World, 1000-501 BC" features Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Students can move from column to column to learn that in about 700 BC, the Scythians spread from Central Asia to Eastern Europe; the Lydians developed coins; cattle and sheep were domesticated in West Africa; and Monte Alb n, sacred city of the Olmecs, was founded in Mexico. In "The Dark Ages, 700-899," the columns shift to Southern and Western Europe; Northern and Eastern Europe; Africa and the Middle East; the Far East; and the Americas. The short essays, generally also contained on double-page spreads, include such topics as the Vikings, the British in India, ancient Egypt, the scramble for Africa, and the Cold War. Small, colorful drawings, photos, and maps appear throughout. While the book makes no attempt to provide an in-depth look at any of its topics, a remarkable amount of information is surveyed and is made more accessible by a detailed index.

It was the beginning of an astounding 64,000-mile voyage that was to take the ship around the world, leaving a trail of destruction and devastation in her wake. For this was no ordinary freighter&#x2014;this was the <i>Wolf, </i>a disguised German warship. <br><br>In this gripping account of an audacious and lethal World War I expedition, Richard Guilliatt and Peter Hohnen depict the <i>Wolf </i>&#x2019;s assignment: to terrorize distant ports of the British Empire by laying minefields and sinking freighters, thus hastening Germany&#x2019;s goal of starving her enemy into submission. Yet to maintain secrecy, she could never pull into port or use her radio, and to comply with the rules of sea warfare, her captain fastidiously tried to avoid killing civilians aboard the merchant ships he attacked, taking their crews and passengers prisoner before sinking the vessels. <br><br>The <i>Wolf </i>thus became a huge floating prison, with more than 400 captives, including a number of women and children, from twenty-five different nations. Sexual affairs were kindled between the German crew and some female prisoners. A six-year-old American girl, captured while sailing across the Pacific with her parents, was adopted as a mascot by the Germans. <br><br>Forced to survive on food and fuel plundered from other ships, facing death from scurvy, and hunted by the combined navies of five Allied nations, the Germans and their prisoners came to share a common bond. The will to survive transcended enmities of race, class, and nationality. <br><br>It was to be one of the most daring clandestine naval missions of modern times. Under the command of Captain Karl Nerger, who conducted his deadly business with an admirable sense of chivalry, the <i>Wolf </i>traversed three of the world&#x2019;s major oceans and destroyed more than thirty Allied vessels. <br><br>We learn of the world through which the <i>Wolf </i>moved, with all its social divisions and xenophobia, its bravery and stoicism, its combination of old-world social mores and rapid technological change. The story of this epic voyage is a vivid real-life narrative and simultaneously a richly detailed picture of a world being profoundly transformed by war.</p><p><b>Richard Guilliatt</b> has been a journalist for 30 years and is the author of the book, <i>Talk Of The Devil &#x2013; Repressed Memory and the Ritual Abuse Witch-Hunt</i> (Text Publishing, Australia, 1996).&nbsp; Born in the UK, he was a feature writer at <i>The Age</i> newspaper in Melbourne, Australia, before moving to New York in 1986 to work as a freelance writer.

His great-uncle, Alexander Ross Ainsworth, was chief engineer aboard the steamship <i>Matunga</i> when it was captured by <i>SMS Wolf</i> in August 1917.During WWI the Germans realized the value of menacing British commercial shipping lanes in the South Pacific. They sent the raider Wolf, disguised as a merchant ship, to lay mines and sink enemy vessels near English-controlled ports. Nearly 800 captured civilians lived aboard the ship during its fifteen-month voyage. The Germans took prisoners for two reasons: to adhere to ancient maritime traditions forbidding the murder of civilians and to avoid disclosure of the Wolf&#39;s secret mission. Michael Page meets the double challenge of credibly delivering British English and the many German names and words. He navigates between the languages flawlessly, adding the perfect touches of bilingualism to a little-known tale of the Great War.

Are you a physical body? A collection of <br>experiences and memories? A partner to relationships? Each time you consider these aspects of yourself, you realize that there is much more to you than any of these can define. In The Untethered Soul, <br>spiritual teacher Michael A. Singer explores the question of who we are and arrives at the conclusion that our identity is to be found in our <br>consciousness, the fact of our ability to observe ourselves, and the world around us. By tapping into traditions of meditation and <br>mindfulness, Singer shows how the development of consciousness can <br>enable us all to dwell in the present moment and let go of painful <br>thoughts and memories that keep us from achieving happiness and <br>self-realization.The Untethered Soul offers a frank and friendly discussion of consciousness and how we can <br>develop it. In part one, Singer examines the notion of self and the inner dialogue we all live with. Part two examines the experience of energy as it flows through us and works to show listeners how to open their hearts to the energy of experience that permeates their lives. Ways to overcome tendencies to close down to the rest of the world are the subject of <br>part three. Enlightenment, the embrace of universal consciousness, is the subject of part four. And finally, in part five, Singer returns to daily life and the pursuit of unconditional happiness. Throughout, the book maintains a light and engaging tone, free from heavy dogma and prescriptive religious references. The easy exercises that figure in each chapter help listeners experience the ideas that Singer presents.</p><p>Michael A. Singer is the founder of Temple of the Universe, a yoga and meditation center, and the author of The Search for Truth and Three Essays on Universal Law: Karma, Will and Love.&#34;Read this book carefully and you will get more than a glimpse of eternity.&#34; ---Deepak Chopra</p><h2>Star Wars: The New Essential Guide to Droids</h2><p>DIFFERENT KIND OF HEAVY METAL SUPERSTAR Whether they&#39;re doctors or diplomats, soldiers or secretaries, translators or nightclub waiters, the myriad mechanical marvels known as droids are an indispensable part of what keeps the Star Wars galaxy humming.

Gass, "the finest prose stylist in America" (Steven Moore, <i>Washington Post</i>). Whether he's exploring the nature of narrative, the extent and cost of political influences on writers, or the relationships between the stories we tell and the moral judgments we make, Gass is always erudite, entertaining, and enlightening.</p><p>For those willing to overlook the author's wandering style and bursts of elitism, William H. Gass's latest series of essays, <i>Tests of Time</i>, yields many rewards. Gass unifies this ambitious work with a focus on the ethics of writing, and, on a more general level, morality. The first of three sections, Literary Matters, includes essays investigating the nature of narrative, experimental fiction, writing's effect on memory and experience, and culture and canonization. The second section, Social and Political Contretemps, explores the influence of politics, religion, censorship, and nationalism on writers, as well as the similarities between American and German culture. Finally, the Stuttgart Seminar Lectures section concerns the value of well-documented history and artistic writing. Gass insists throughout that only through creative, brave, and responsible writing can humanity avert moral degeneration--and he often succeeds in powerfully conveying and inspiring this point. His thorough reading of Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i> beautifully emphasizes the role of poetry in our connection with the past and present. "There Was an Old Woman Who" entertains and informs with its use of a largely forgotten case of urban cannibalism as an example of the need for accurate documentation and a moral view of history. Unfortunately Gass often muddles his valuable ideas with overlong ranting, inflammatory rhetoric, and out-of-touch popular-culture criticisms. The author is easily at his best when he remains succinct and organized yet impassioned, as he does in the collection's excellent final essay, "Transformations." Here and elsewhere, Gass delivers a modernist critique in every way exemplifying the courage, skill, and consciousness in writing that he so values. <i>--Ross Doll</i><b>William H.

He treats European witchcraft as a product of Christianity, grounded in heresy more than in the magic and sorcery that have existed in other societies. Skillfully blending narration with analysis, he shows how social and religious changes nourished the spread of witchcraft until large portions of medieval Europe were in its grip&#x2015;"from the most illiterate peasant to the most skilled philosopher or scientist."</p><p>A significant chapter in the history of ideas and their repression is illuminated by this book. Our growing fascination with the occult gives the author's affirmation that witchcraft arises at times and in areas afflicted with social tensions a special quality of immediacy.</p></p><p><p>Jeffrey Burton Russell is Professor of History Emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><p>"Russell's contribution will undoubtedly become a standard reference work on witchcraft. It is a clear, straightforward account resting on meticulous textual analysis and comprehensive documentation."</p> (<i>The Review of Books and Religion</i>)<br><br><p>"A magnificent history.... Russell's survey of modern literature on the subject is in itself almost a major contribution, and his careful period-by-period and phase-by-phase description of the development of witchcraft through the fifteenth century is indispensable to any further serious treatment of the phenomenon in Europe."</p> (<i>Georgia Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Russell fills a real gap in the literature. He does so with the scholarly probity and sound good sense that arc the absolute prerequisites for any serious work on the subject, and he has composed his book for the general reader as well as the specialist.... In the course of his narrative Russell successfully lays to rest any number of erroneous 'well-known facts,' and he demonstrates that classical witchcraft was largely a creature of Christianity and that heresy was the strongest influence on its development as an idea."</p> (<i>History</i>)<br><br><p>"The study of witchcraft is of more than fleeting interest. To understand this phenomenon is to acquire a more profound understanding of man, society, and self. Thus Russell's book is of singular importance.... With insight the author demonstrates how political, social, economic, religious, and intellectual developments either fostered or militated against the growth of witchcraft."</p> (<i>Church History</i>)</p><h2>Kerouac and Friends: A Beat Generation Album</h2><p>A nostalgic portrait of the Beat Generation and its impact on American literature and culture, as viewed through the eyes of writers of the era</p><p></p><h2>Independent Spirit: Essays</h2><p>Collects essays by the Irish writer on such diverse topics as abortion, the liberation of Austrian Jews, Irish literature, and Yugoslavia</p><p>These essays, selected from four volumes published in Ireland in 1985, reveal a man with a fascinating breadth of experience and the ability to write of his life with wit, style, and integrity. Born into a Protestant Anglo-Irish family and educated at Oxford, Butler traveled widely, studying and teaching in Egypt, the Soviet Union, and the Balkans for nearly 15 years. During Hitler&#39;s reign of terror in the early 1940s, he even helped Jews escape through Vienna. When his father died, he returned to Ireland and turned his experiences into essays, writing about European and world issues--sectarianism in the former Yugoslavia, the struggle between the Roman Catholic Church and Communism, the sending of 4,051 children to the Auschwitz death camp--from a broad humanistic (yet still very Irish) perspective. Hubert Butler died in Ireland in 1991 as a relatively unknown yet luminous talent who observed this century with a rigorous eye.Elisabeth Sifton, senior vice president of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, lives in New York City and in Princeton, New Jersey.</p><h2>I Am Number Four Movie Tie-in Edition (Lorien Legacies, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>The first book of the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling series and the inspiration for the hit movie from Dreamworks!</strong></p><p>John Smith seems like an ordinary teenager, living a normal life with his guardian Henri in Paradise, Ohio.

In a compelling book full of the extraordinary stories of ordinary people, Elaine Forman Crane reveals the ways in which early Americans clashed with or conformed to the social norms established by the law. As trials throughout the country reveal, alleged malefactors such as witches, wife beaters, and whores, as well as debtors, rapists, and fornicators, were as much a part of the social landscape as farmers, merchants, and ministers. Ordinary people "made" law by establishing and enforcing informal rules of conduct. Codified by a handshake or over a mug of ale, such agreements became custom and custom became "law." Furthermore, by submitting to formal laws initiated from above, common folk legitimized a government that depended on popular consent to rule with authority. </p><p>In this book we meet Marretie Joris, a New Amsterdam entrepreneur who sues Gabriel de Haes for calling her a whore; peer cautiously at Christian Stevenson, a Bermudian witch as bad "as any in the world;" and learn that Hannah Dyre feared to be alone with her husband&#x2015;and subsequently died after a beating. We travel with Comfort Taylor as she crosses Narragansett Bay with Cuff, an enslaved ferry captain, whom she accuses of attempted rape, and watch as Samuel Banister pulls the trigger of a gun that kills the sheriff&#x2019;s deputy who tried to evict Banister from his home. And finally, we consider the promiscuous Marylanders Thomas Harris and Ann Goldsborough, who parented four illegitimate children, ran afoul of inheritance laws, and resolved matters only with the assistance of a ghost. Through the six trials she skillfully reconstructs here, Crane offers a surprising new look at how early American society defined and punished aberrant behavior, even as it defined itself through its legal system.</p></p><p><p>Elaine Forman Crane is Professor of History at Fordham University. She is the author of several books, including <i>Killed Strangely: The Death of Rebecca Cornell</i>, also from Cornell.</p><p>"In Elaine Forman Crane's deft retelling, tales of Bermuda witches, domestic violence and a rape accusation in Rhode Island, gossipers in New Amsterdam, and a Maryland ghost offer us revealing windows into the legal culture of early America. Her careful analyses will intrigue and enlighten all readers of this remarkable volume."</p> (Mary Beth Norton, Mary Donlon Alger Professor of American HistoryCornell University author of <i>Separated by Their Sex: Women in Public and Private in the Colonial Atlantic World</i>)<br><br><p>"With sensitivity and imagination, Elaine Forman Crane recaptures little-known episodes of witchcraft, murder, sexual assault, and domestic violence. She skillfully explores how deeply ingrained understandings of law and legal culture shaped the behavior of ordinary people in early America&#x2015;whether victims, perpetrators, or neighbors. The book is a model of how legal sources can be mined to illuminate the workings of property, power, race, and gender in everyday life."</p> (Bruce H. Mann, Carl F. Schipper Jr. Professor of Law, Harvard Law School, author of <i>Republic of Debtors: Bankruptcy in the Age of American Independence</i>)<br><br><p>"Elaine Forman Crane writes with verve, wit, and clarity. Each chapter of this book is a little gem, a self-contained historical narrative that conveys both the larger context and the specific information necessary to understand the issues at stake. Readers will find themselves engrossed in a fascinating array of tales that range from a shocking instance of family violence in early New England, to an ambiguous case of purported interracial rape in Rhode Island, to the surprisingly persistent belief in witches in colonial Bermuda and Maryland."</p> (Rosemarie Zagarri, George Mason University author of <i>Revolutionary Backlash: Women and Politics in the Early American Republic</i>)</p><h2>A Morning with Grandpa</h2><p>Mei Mei s grandpa is practicing tai chi in the garden, and Mei Mei is eager to join in.

Winner of the LEE &amp; LOW New Voices Award, this title celebrates, with lively spirit and humor, the special bond between grandparent and grandchild and the joy of learning new things together. Readers of all ages will want to try out some tai chi and yoga too!</p><p>SYLVIA LIU was inspired to write this story by the playful and loving relationship between her children and their Gong Gong. Before devoting herself to writing and illustrating children s books, she worked as an environmental lawyer at the US Department of Justice and the nonprofit group Oceana. She lives in Virginia with her husband and their two daughters. This is her debut picture book.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;A bright and cheery girl and her grandfather spend a morning teaching each other tai chi and yoga in this sweet, intergenerational picture book. Mei Mei, an adorable girl with pigtails and flair, is curious about the slow dancing that Gong Gong does. She is determined to replicate his actions but instead bursts with energy, creating her own bouncing movements. Mei Mei decides to teach Gong Gong the yoga poses that she learned in school, but his elderly body cannot twist and turn as agilely as hers. In the end, they each assure the other that their movements are "perfect," sending a sweet message that it is the process and the practice that are important. Digitally rendered illustrations place Mei Mei and Gong Gong in a lush backyard garden filled with sunflowers, red maple leaves, and dragonflies. While the background images are repetitive, the focus of the illustrations is on the intergenerational pair. Mei Mei's face expresses a full range of emotions, while Gong Gong's is somewhat one-note. The text is brimming with similes and metaphors describing their movements, and the words follow the actions, with the letters in words such as arched and stretched curving and bending on the page. Descriptions of the movements do not overwhelm the story, and a full set of instructions for the poses, as well as discussions of the practices, are included as back matter. VERDICT This selection stands out from other yoga picture books for its introduction to tai chi and will circulate well in collections where there is an interest in movement, health, and fitness activities.&#x2014;Clara Hendricks, Cambridge Public Library, MA</p><h2>Christmas Around the World</h2><p>Christmas is celebrated around the world and children love to discover how their brothers and sisters in different lands celebrate Jesus' birth.

The new city was Venice, and he spent much of the last decade wandering through its canals and palazzos, seeking to understand a place that any native will tell you is easy to visit but hard to know. For travelers to Venice, whether by armchair or vaporetto, he has selected his 10 (actually 11) Books to Read on Venice. And he took the time to answer a few of our questions about his charming new book, <i>The City of Falling Angels</i>: </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The lush, cloistered southern city of Savannah was the locale of <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>. Venice, the setting for <i>The City of Falling Angels</i>, is vastly different. Was it the difference itself that drew you to Venice? </p><p><strong>John Berendt:</strong> Savannah and Venice actually have quite a lot in common. Both are uniquely beautiful. Both are isolated geographically, culturally, and emotionally from the world outside. Venice sits in the middle of a lagoon; Savannah is surrounded by marshes, piney woods, and the ocean. Venetians think of themselves as Venetian first, Italian second; Savannahians rarely even venture forth as far as Atlanta or Charleston. So both cities offer a writer a rich context in which to set a story, and the stories provide readers a means of escape from their own environment into another world. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> I enjoyed your rather declarative author's note: that this is a work of nonfiction, and that you used everyone's real names. In your previous book you did use pseudonyms for some characters and you explained that you took a few small liberties in the service of the larger truth of the story. Why the change this time? </p><p><strong>Berendt:</strong> When I wrote <i>Midnight</i> I thought I would do a few people the favor of changing their names for the sake of privacy. But when the book came out, several of the pseudonymous characters told me they wished I'd used their real names instead. So this time, no pseudonyms. As for the storytelling liberties I took in writing <i>Midnight</i>, they were minor and did not change the story, but my mention of it in the author's note caused some confusion, with the result that <i>Midnight</i> is sometimes referred to now as a novel, which it most certainly is not. Neither is <i>The City of Falling Angels</i>. In fact, I dispensed with the liberties this time and made it as close to the truth as I could get it. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> In <i>The City of Falling Angels</i>, a number of fascinating people serve as guides to the city, each with a different idea of the true nature of Venice. Who was your favorite? </p><p><strong>Berendt:</strong> I don't have a favorite, but Count Girolamo Marcello is certainly a memorable, highly quotable commentator. "Everyone in Venice is acting," he told me. "Everyone plays a role, and the role changes. The key to understanding Venetians is rhythm, the rhythm of the lagoon, the water, the tides, the waves. It's like breathing. High water, high pressure: tense. Low water, low pressure: relaxed. The tide changes every six hours." </p><p>I nodded that I understood. </p><p>"How do you see a bridge?" he went on. </p><p>"Pardon me?" I asked, "A bridge?" </p><p>"Do you see a bridge as an obstacle--as just another set of steps to climb to get from one side of a canal to the other? We Venetians do not see bridges as obstacles. To us, bridges are transitions. We go over them very slowly. They are part of the rhythm. They are the links between two parts of a theater, like changes in scenery. Our role changes as we go over bridges. We cross from one reality ... to another reality. From one street ... to another street. From one setting ... to another setting." </p><p>Once I had absorbed that notion, Count Marcello continued: "Sunlight on a canal is reflected up through a window onto the ceiling, then from the ceiling onto a vase, and from the vase onto a glass. Which is the real sunlight? Which is the real reflection? What is true? What is not true? The answer is not so simple, because the truth can change. I can change. You can change. That is the Venice effect." </p><p>I was not terribly surprised when he later told me, "Venetians never tell the truth. We mean precisely the opposite of what we say." </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Now that you know Venice well enough to be a guide yourself, what would you say to a visitor looking for insight into the character of the city? </p><p><strong>Berendt:</strong> Tourists generally shuffle along, on narrow streets so crowded as to be nearly impassable, between the major sights of St. Mark's Square, the Rialto Bridge, and the Accademia Museum. All you have to do is to step off these heavily traveled alleyways, and in a few moments you will find yourself in quiet, much emptier surroundings. This is more like the real Venice. Another thing to do is to go into the wine bars where Venetians stand around drinking and talking. They will very likely be speaking the Venetian dialect, so you won't be able to understand them, but you will get a sampling of the true Venetian ambiance enlivened by the pronounced sing-song rhythm of the language. I'd also suggest stopping someone in the street and asking for directions. Almost invariably, you will be rewarded with a genial smile and the instructions, <i>Sempre diritto</i>, meaning "Straight ahead." This will only leave you more confused, because when you attempt to follow a straight line, you will be confronted by more twists and turns and forks in the road than you thought possible, given the instructions. This is part of what Count Marcello described as "the Venice effect." </p>John Berendt writes a monthly column for <b>Esquire</b>.

As editors for the promising In My Own Words series, the Roops organize and prepare the first-person accounts of historical figures and modernize spelling and punctuation to make the writing clear and accessible to young readers. Because each book is short, printed in relatively large type, and illustrated with several attractive watercolor paintings, the result is a series of history books that look appealing, read well, and carry the conviction of original accounts. Page-long sidebars fill in background information that students will need to better understand the times. Based on Jemison's oral account of her story as recorded by James Seaver and published in 1824, the "diary" of Mary Jemison describes her capture by Indians at the age of 12, her adoption by a Seneca family, and her life with the Native Americans. Leeper's story, taken from a book he published in 1894, doesn't read like a diary either, but it is a lively account of his life as forty-niner. Beginning in Indiana, it recounts his adventures crossing the country by wagon train and prospecting for gold in California. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He is a director of The Ian Fleming Foundation.The creakiest exercise yet in American Bond fan Benson's postmodern resurrection of Ian Fleming's peerless killer spy, has an embarrassingly witless 007 going rogue to fight a dastardly multinational crime cartel.Two months after the calamitous conclusion of High Time to Kill (1999), Bond is still depressed over the death of lover Helen Marksbury. He's also on medical leave, under the care of comely Dr. Kimberely Feare, taking pills that are supposed to heal a brain lesion but do little more than leave him paranoid and prone to blackouts. Unknown to Bond, the American white supremacists who call themselves the Union have revamped themselves into a wealthy criminal club that holds meetings in swank, dimly lit underground boardrooms presided over by the mysterious Le Gerant, a blind man who forgoes canes because he can psychically sense his surroundings. Aided by sadomasochistic sexpot Margareta Piel, Le Gerant has found a crazed Bond look-alike willing to undergo plastic surgery, wear Brioni suits, and commit un-Bondly crimes, such as killing Dr. Feare moments after she forsakes medical ethics to succumb to the real Bond's &#x201c;overwhelming masculinity.&#x201d; Meanwhile, Spanish powerbroker (and Union member) Domingo Espada, who publicly manages bullfighters and privately kidnaps poor girls and turns them into sex slaves, has set up a meeting with the various heads of state to demand the return of Gibraltar to Spain. At the climax of the meeting, pseudo-Bond will kill the British Prime Minister. Of course, the one true Bond can thwart only so much gratuitous overplotting by himself, so he swipes a handgun from the Q Branch armory (almost no gadgetry in this outing, alas), falls in with voluptuous CIA twins Heidi and Hedy Taunt, and, after a inconvenient blackout, awakens in Espada's bullring, where he must first use his wits against a charging bull and then fight pseudo-Bond to the death. Nifty bullfighting scenes do not redeem an otherwise clich�-cluttered narrative. For die-hard fans only. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Tour.</p><p>Stewart has written a vivid portrait of political power, political and personal intrigue, and how information, controlled and manipulated at the right time, can change the course of lives, careers, and ultimately, history. This is the story of the Clintons, from their days in Little Rock to their behavior under duress in the White House; their business partners, who swept the Clintons into their real estate empire, then faced financial ruin; and their many political and business allies who have been tarnished by association, including the tragic Vincent Foster. For anyone interested in American democracy, the revelations of <b>Blood Sport</b> will reverberate through this and future presidencies.In July 1993, White House official Vincent Foster wrote an anguished lament: "in Washington...ruining people is considered a sport." <p> Nine days later, Foster was dead. Shock at the apparent suicide of one of President Clinton's top aides turned to mystery, then suspicion, as the White House became engulfed in an ever-widening net of unanswered questions. Among the confidential matters Foster was working on when he died was the Clinton's ill-fated investment in Whitewater, an Arkansas land development. Soon conspiracy theories were circulating, alleging that Foster was murdered because he knew too much. And the Whitewater affair, a minor footnote to the 1992 presidential campaign, was suddenly resurrected in the national media. To a degree that left them sunned and at times depressed, the president and the first lady have been buffeted by a succession of scandals, from the first lady's profitable commodities trading to the sexual harassment allegations of Paula Jonesl Like his predecessors, the Clinton presidency son found itself engulfed in allegations of scandal, conspiracy, and cover-up. </p><p> Drawing on hundreds of interviews, many with people speaking publicly for the first time, James B. Stewart also sheds startling new light on these and other mysteries of the Clinton White House. In a fast-paced narrative that ranges from a backwater town in the Ozarks to the Oval Office, from newsrooms in New York and Los Angeles to offices of conservative think tanks and special prosecutors, the result is an unprecedented portrait of political combat as it is waged in America today. </p><p> Here, in detailed reporting, is the story of how these alleged scandals burst upon the national stage; who nurtured and exploited them; how the president, first lady, and members of their administration reacted and why; how the allegations were dealt with by the media; and what the impact has been on the principal characters and on national policy. This story shows the president and first lady as they really are, both in their rapid rise from Arkansas politics and acting under duress in the White House. It is the story of the people around them, many disgraced or tarnished by what happened: Bernard Nussbaum, the embattled White House counsel; Webb Hubbell, the Arkansas ally at the Justice Department who confessed to felonies; Bill Kennedy, a top White House lawyer forced to return to Little Rock. And it is the full story of Vince Foster, a quiet, reserved, and loyal confidant and friend of the first family whose tortured career in Washington can be seen as a metaphor for the toll public service exacts today. </p><p> Going beyond the news headlines, Blood Sport also tells the fascinating stories of key figures at the heart of the action, such as Jim McDougal, once Clinton's political and financial mentor, and his glamorous but naive wife, Susan, who swept up the Clintons into their real estate empire, then faced financial ruin. It is the story of top national reporters and editors such as Jeff Gerth of The New York Times, who broke the Whitewater story only to find himself the object of controversy. It is the story of David Bossie, the tireless conservative operative who became a one-man army against the Clintons and even penetrated a network news operation. It is the story of Paula Jones, a small-town girl with dreams of Hollywood, and of the Arkansas state troopers who broke their code of silence to add fuel to the Clinton scandals. It is the story of prosecutors Kenneth Starr and Robert Fiske, the secretive, powerful independent counsels whose wide-ranging investigations could vindicate - or destroy - a president. </p><p> Set against a backdrop of national affairs and political intrigue, Blood Sport is more than the story of the Clintons' political trial by combat. It is a vivid portrait of our times, destined to be an enduring examination of political power and its limitations, of information and its dissemination, and, ultimately, of human nature. For anyone interested in American democracy, the revelations of Blood Sport will reverberate for this and future presidencies.</p></p><h2>Ketogenic Bread: Low Carb Keto Bread Bakers Cookbook with COLOR PHOTOS, Serving Size, And Nutrition Facts For Every Keto Bread Recipe!</h2><p><b>Kindle MatchBook: The Kindle edition is FREE when you buy the paperback edition today!</b> <p><b>Dozens of delicious low carb bread recipes that are fully ketogenic!

Like others in the series, this one includes extensive notes and background information on each story by editor Paul Williams. The early 1950s, during which this material was written, was the beginning of Sturgeon's greatest creative period. The title story for this collection was later expanded into the International Fantasy Award winning novel<i> More Than Human</i>. Sturgeon's whimsical, sardonic sense of humor lifts his work out of the mundane realm of genre science fiction. This wide-ranging collection shows precisely why he has been cited as a primary influence by authors as varied as Stephen King, Ray Bradbury, and Carl Sagan.</p><p>Theodore Sturgeon was born on February 26, 1918 in Staten Island, New York. He died in Eugene, Oregon, on May 8, 1985. A resident of New York City, upstate New York, and Los Angeles, he is the author of more than thirty novels and short story collections."Historically, the <i>Complete Sturgeon</i> is one of the most important reissues in years. In terms of reading, this is a goldmine both for those already familiar with Sturgeon's work and for a new generation of readers ready for something real."-<i>Strange Worlds Magazine</i>"Theodore Sturgeon has become a kind of patron saint of SF short story writers. His fiction demonstrated a love of humanity and an understanding of human emotion unparalleled in the field. At the time of his death in 1985, no short story writer was held in so high a regard."-David Brin, author of <i>Heaven's Reach </i></p><h2>A Constructed View: The Architectural Photography of Julius Shulman</h2><p>Julius Shulman, one of the great master of architectural photography, is the preeminent recoreder of early California modernism. By 1927, when he was sixteen, Shulman was already using the family Brownie box camera to document his Southern Californis surroundings and experiences; in 1936, his professional career was launched when he sent Richard Neutra some uncommissioned photographs of the architect's Kun House. Shulman went on to document the famous Case Study House Program (architects included Charles and Ray Eames, Pierre Koenig, and Eero Saarinen) and also the architecure of the 1930s through the 1980s, especially that of Southern California, but also country and worldwide. His subjects included the buildings of R.M. Schindler, John Lautner, Raphael Soriano, Frank Lloyd Wright, Mies van der Rohe, Oscar Niemeyer, among many others. Through his work, Shulman defined the image of Los Angeles and framed the architecture of the time for a global audience. In addition to an overview of Shulman's career and photographic oevre, this book emphasizes Shulman's method of "constructing" photographic views. These contructions, which complemented his innate ability to compose striking photographs, often transcends reality to capture the spirit, time and place of a work of architecture. An analysis of architecture's visual presentation examines not only the media of the era--John Entenza's Arts &amp; Architecture, for instance--but also the work of Shulman's photographic contemporaries.</p><p>Julius Shulman, one of the great masters of modern architectual photography, is the pre-eminent recorder of early California modernism.Architectural photographer Julius Shulman left indelible images of early California modernism in his photographs of buildings by Richard Neutra, Frank Lloyd Wright, Charles and Ray Eames, Rudolph Schindler and others. Shulman's seductive compositions helped define the popular image of California, especially Los Angeles, as a place of promise where one could remake oneself. Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1910, Shulman, who moved to California at age 10 after living on a Connecticut farm, has a reverence for the order he perceives in both natural and architectural forms. Crystalline studies of lakes and boats, shots of Mexican pyramids and a traditional Norwegian house, lyrical photos of oil refineries and of Henry Moore's sculpture exemplify his diversity. This visually exciting portfolio includes sensitive appreciations by Rosa, director of Columbia University's Architectural Galleries, and the late McCoy, historian of Southern California architecture. <p></p><p>Copyright 1994 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Midnight in Sicily: On Art, Food, History, Travel, and La Cosa Nostra</h2><p>Chronicles the relationship of Italy&#39;s high-ranking politicians with the Sicily Mafia from the end of World War II to the present</p><p>Peter Robb was born in Toorak in 1946 and grew up in Australia and New Zealand. He arrived in Europe in 1971, working as a night-club bouncer in England, a philologist in Finland, and a teacher in France. He returned to Australia in the mid &#39;70s and there taught English to immigrants. In 1978 he set off for South America, but he got no further than Naples. He spent the next 15 years in southern Italy teaching and writing. He has recently completed a book on Carvaggio entitled M.If it's true, as the Sicilian writer Leonardo Sciascia once said, that Sicily is a metaphor for the modern world, then author Robb has plumbed the depths of the world. Midnight in Sicily is a work from another age and era. Perhaps only in the 18th and 19th centuries would a foreigner have attempted to write about art, food, history, travel, and the Mafia together. But it soon becomes apparent that in the hands of Robb the landscape of Sicily becomes a metaphor for its history; history is inextricably tied to food; food is inseparable from art. Again, it takes a foreigner to see Italy and Sicily in clearer terms than the Sicilians and Italians themselves. The heart of darkness in this tale is Giulio Andreotti, the most powerful politician in postwar Italy: seven-time prime minister and once hailed as the greatest political mind since Bismarck. Ironically, Andreotti is a Roman who sold his soul in Sicily in a Faustian bargain to secure a political power base from which to rule Italy practically undisturbed for decades. Robb, who has written for the Times Literary Supplement and the London Review of Books, masterfully recreates scenes as benevolent as friends enjoying a meal or as diabolical as Andreotti's meeting with the most brutal crime boss in all of Italy. There are shrewd insights (``Beyond a certain threshold, power erases embarrassment''); telling phrases (Andreotti, leader of the Christian Democrats, is called a ``sacristy rat''); and deep political/historical revelations (such as Cosa Nostra's permanent aim of eliminating the historic memory built up by those few who've understood that Cosa Nostra was a state within a state). A barbecue becomes an occasion for a learned excursus on the history of the fork. This narrative is itself an eclectic and sumptuous meal that- -through no fault of the author's--leaves the diner with a bitter taste in the mouth. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It consists of six short stories in dialogue form, drawing on Nerdrum's experiences in Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Russia and Germany, and spanning "The Last Days of Immanuel Kant" in the eighteenth century through to our time, and into the future. The theme of cheating takes various forms: Kant cheats the Dutch painter Haan Van Meegeren who in turn deceives the world with his forgeries; a German writer is cheated by his country after the Second World War; the protagonist of "The Diamond Man" is cheated by a spirit; in "The Sleepwalker" a Swedish painter is continually cheated by his environment; in "Marlowe" a neglected poet cheats the system that had ignored him for years; and the concluding story, "After Armageddon," ends with an explosion of all kinds of cheating against a backdrop of torture and slaughter.</p><p></p><h2>Dark Matter: The Private Life of Sir Isaac Newton</h2><p><i>I swore not to tell this story while Newton was still alive.</i><br><br>1696, young Christopher Ellis is sent to the Tower of London, but not as a prisoner. Though Ellis is notoriously hotheaded and was caught fighting an illegal duel, he arrives at the Tower as assistant to the renowned scientist Sir Isaac Newton. Newton is Warden of the Royal Mint, which resides within the Tower walls, and he has accepted an appointment from the King of England and Parliament to investigate and prosecute counterfeiters whose false coins threaten to bring down the shaky, war-weakened economy. Ellis may lack Newton&#x2019;s scholarly mind, but he is quick with a pistol and proves himself to be an invaluable sidekick and devoted apprentice to Newton as they zealously pursue these criminals.<br><br>While Newton and Ellis investigate a counterfeiting ring, they come upon a mysterious coded message on the body of a man killed in the Lion Tower, as well as alchemical symbols that indicate this was more than just a random murder. Despite Newton&#x2019;s formidable intellect, he is unable to decipher the cryptic message or any of the others he and Ellis find as the body count increases within the Tower complex. As they are drawn into a wild pursuit of the counterfeiters that takes them from the madhouse of Bedlam to the squalid confines of Newgate prison and back to the Tower itself, Newton and Ellis discover that the counterfeiting is only a small part of a larger, more dangerous plot, one that reaches to the highest echelons of power and nobility and threatens much more than the collapse of the economy. <br><br><b>Dark Matter</b> is the lastest masterwork of suspense from Philip Kerr, the internationally bestselling and brilliantly innovative thriller writer who has dazzled readers with his imaginative, fast-paced novels.

By the author of Red Tide and The Prometheus Project. Original.</p><p></p><h2>Goya</h2><p>Robert Hughes, who has stunned us with comprehensive works on subjects as sweeping and complex as the history of Australia (<b>The Fatal Shore</b>), the modern art movement (<b>The Shock of the New</b>), the nature of American art (<b>American Visions</b>), and the nature of America itself as seen through its art (<b>The Culture of Complaint</b>), now turns his renowned critical eye to one of art history&#x2019;s most compelling, enigmatic, and important figures, Francisco Jos� de Goya y Lucientes. With characteristic critical fervor and sure-eyed insight, Hughes brings us the story of an artist whose life and work bridged the transition from the eighteenth-century reign of the old masters to the early days of the nineteenth-century moderns. <br><br>With his salient passion for the artist and the art, Hughes brings Goya vividly to life through dazzling analysis of a vast breadth of his work. Building upon the historical evidence that exists, Hughes tracks Goya&#x2019;s development, as man and artist, without missing a beat, from the early works commissioned by the Church, through his long, productive, and tempestuous career at court, to the darkly sinister and cryptic work he did at the end of his life. <br>In a work that is at once interpretive biography and cultural epic, Hughes grounds Goya firmly in the context of his time, taking us on a wild romp through Spanish history; from the brutality and easy violence of street life to the fiery terrors of the Holy Inquisition to the grave realities of war, Hughes shows us in vibrant detail the cultural forces that shaped Goya&#x2019;s work. <br><br>Underlying the exhaustive, critical analysis and the rich historical background is Hughes&#x2019;s own intimately personal relationship to his subject. This is a book informed not only by lifelong love and study, but by his own recent experiences of mortality and death. As such this is a uniquely moving and human book; with the same relentless and fearless intelligence he has brought to every subject he has ever tackled, Hughes here transcends biography to bring us a rich and fiercely brave book about art and life, love and rage, impotence and death. This is one genius writing at full capacity about another&#x2014;and the result is truly spectacular.</p><p>"Robert Hughes's dazzling new study of Goya not only conveys the range and prescience of the artist's work with enormous acuity and verve, but also conjures the world of 18th- and early 19th-century Spain with vivid, pictorial ardor.<br>Writing in fierce, tactile prose, Mr. Hughes jolts the reader into a visceral appreciation of Goya's art.<br>&#x2013;Michiko Kakutani, <i>NewY orkTimes</i><br>"[<i>Goya</i>] is all you could ask for and more.

An American heiress, Eleanor married into the British aristocracy, giving up the grandeur of her upbringing for "good works" freely bestowed on everyone but her own son, who finds himself questioning whether his transition to a life without parents will indeed be the liberation he had so long imagined. </p><p>The service ends, and family and friends gather for a final party. Amid the social niceties and social horrors, Patrick begins to sense the prospect of release from the extremes of his childhood, and at the end of the day, alone in his room, the promise some form of safety. . . <i>at last</i>.</p></p><p><p><b>Edward St. Aubyn</b> was born in London in 1960.

'I've become rather a memorial-creeper. One's bound to at my age. It's no use sitting at home guffawing over the ignorant mistakes of juvenile obituarists, or giving in to the rather monotonous pleasure of counting the daily quota of extinct contemporaries. No! One has to "celebrate the life": there goes the school tart. They say he had a good war, but I know better! - that sort of thing, put the whole achievement in perspective. Mind you, I'm not saying it isn't all very moving. There's a sort of swelling orchestra effect to these last days. And plenty of horror, of course. Padding about on my daily rounds from hospital bed to memorial pew and back again, I'm reminded of those oil tankers that used to dash themselves onto the rocks every other week and the flocks of birds dying on the beaches with their wings stuck together and their bewildered yellow eyes blinking.'</p><p>Nicholas glanced into the room. 'Thinly attended,' he murmured, as if preparing a description for someone else. 'Are those people your mother's religious friends? Too extraordinary. What colour would you call that suit? Aubergine? Aubergine � la cr�me d'oursin? I must go to Huntsman and get one knocked up. What do you mean, you have no Aubergine? Everyone was wearing it at Eleanor Melrose's. Order a mile of it straight away!</p><p>'I suppose your aunt will be here soon. She'll be an all too familiar face amidst the Aubergines. I saw her last week in New York and I'm pleased to say I was the first to tell her the tragic news about your mother. She burst into tears and ordered a croque monsieur to swallow with her second helping of diet pills. I felt sorry for her and got her asked to dinner with the Blands. Do you know Freddie Bland? He's the smallest billionaire alive. His parents were practically dwarfs, into the room with a tremendous fanfare and then like General and Mrs. Tom Thumb. They used to come disappear under a console table. Baby Bland has taken to being serious, the way some people do in their senile twilight. She's decided to write a book about Cubism, of all ridiculous subjects. I think it's really part of her being a perfect wife. She knows what a state Freddie used to get into over her birthday, but thanks to her new hobby, all he has to do now is get Sotheby's to wrap up a revolting painting of a woman with a face like a slice of watermelon by that arch fake Picasso, and he knows she'll be over the moon. Do you know what Baby said to me? At breakfast, if you please, when I was almost defenceless.' Nicholas put on a simpering voice:</p><p>'"Those divine birds in late Braque are really just an excuse for the sky."</p><p>'"Such a good excuse," I said, choking on my first sip of coffee, "so much better than a lawn mower or a pair of clogs. It shows he was in complete control of his material."</p><p>'Serious, you see. It's a fate I shall resist with every last scrap of my intelligence, unless Herr Doktor Alzheimer takes over, in which case I'll have to write a book about Islamic art to show that the towel-heads have always been much more civilized than us, or a fat volume on how little we know about Shakespeare's mother and her top-secret Catholicism. Something serious.</p><p>'Anyhow, I'm afraid Aunt Nancy rather bombed with the Blands. It must be hard to be exclusively social and entirely friendless at the same time. Poor thing. But do you know what struck me, apart from Nancy's vibrant self-pity, which she had the nerve to pretend was grief, what struck me about those two girls, your mother and your aunt, was that they are, were - my life is spent wobbling between tenses - completely American. Their father's connection with the Highlands was, let's face it, entirely liquid and after your grandmother sacked him he was hardly ever around. He spent the war with those dimwits the Windsors in Nassau; Monte Carlo after the war, and finally foundered in the bar of White's. Of the tribe who are blind drunk every day of their lives from lunch until bedtime, he was by far the most charming, but frustrating I think as a father. At that level of drunkenness one's essentially trying to embrace a drowning man. The odd eruption of sentimentality for the twenty minutes the drink took him that way was no substitute for the steady flow of self-sacrificing kindness that has always inspired my own efforts as a father. With what I admit have been mixed results. As I'm sure you know, Amanda hasn't spoken to me for the last fifteen years. I blame her psychoanalyst, filling her never very brilliant little head with Freudian ideas about her doting Papa.'</p><p>Nicholas's rotund style of delivery was fading into an increasingly urgent whisper, and the knuckles of his blue-veined hands were white from the effort of holding himself upright. 'Well, my dear, we'll have another little chat after the ceremony. It's been marvellous finding you on such good form. My condolences and all that, although if ever there was a "merciful release", it was in the case of your poor mother. I've become something of a Florence Nightingale in my old age, but even the Lady with the Lamp had to beat a retreat in the face of that terrifying ruin. It's bound to act as a brake on the rush to get me canonized but I prefer to pay visits to people who can still enjoy a bitchy remark and a glass of champagne.'</p><p>He seemed about to leave but then turned back. 'Try not to be bitter about the money. One or two friends of mine who've made a mess of that side of things have ended up dying in National Health wards and I must say I've been very impressed by the humanity of the mostly foreign staff. Mind you, what is there to do with money except spend it when you've got it or be bitter about it when you haven't? It's a very limited commodity in which people invest the most extraordinary emotions. What I suppose I really mean is do be bitter about the money; it's one of the few things it can do: siphon off some bitterness. Do-gooders have sometimes complained that I have too many b�tes noires, but I need my b�tes noires to get the noire out of me and into the b�tes. Besides, that side of your family has had a good run. What is it now? Six generations with every single descendant, not just the eldest son, essentially idle. They may have taken on the camouflage of work, especially in America where everyone has to have an office, if only to swivel about with their shoes on the desk for half an hour before lunch, but there's been no necessity. It must be rather thrilling, although I can't speak from experience, for you and your children, after this long exemption from competition, to get stuck in. God knows what I would have made of my life if I hadn't divided my time between town and country, between home and abroad, between wives and mistresses. I have divided time and now doth time divide me, what? I must take a closer look at these religious fanatics your mother surrounded herself with.'</p><p>Nicholas hobbled off with no pretence that he expected any response other than silent fascination.</p><p>When Patrick looked back on the way that illness and dying had torn apart Eleanor's flimsy shamanic fantasies, Nicholas's 'religious fanatics' seemed to him more like credulous draft-dodgers. At the end of her life Eleanor had been thrown into a merciless crash-course in self-knowledge, with only a 'power animal' in one hand and a rattle in the other. She had been left with the steepest practice of all: no speech, no movement, no sex, no drugs, no travel, no spending, hardly any food; just alone in silent contemplation of her thoughts. If contemplation was the word. Perhaps she felt that her thoughts were contemplating her, like hungry predators.</p><p>'Were you thinking about her?' said a soft Irish voice. Annette rested a healing hand on Patrick's forearm and tilted her understanding head to one side.</p><p>'I was thinking that a life is just the history of what we give our attention to,' said Patrick. 'The rest is packaging.'</p><p>'Oh, I think that's too stark,' said Annette. 'Maya Angelou says that the meaning of our lives is the impact we have on other people, whether we make them feel good or not. Eleanor always made people feel good, it was one of her gifts to the world. Oh,' she added with sudden excitement, gripping Patrick's forearm, 'I only made this connection on the way in: we're in Mortlake crematorium to say farewell to Eleanor, and guess what I took to read to her on the last occasion I saw her. You'll never guess. The Lady of the Lake. It's an Arthurian whodunit, not very good actually. But that says it all, doesn't it? Lady of the lake - Mortlake. Given Eleanor's connection with water and her love of the Arthurian legends.'</p><p>Patrick was stunned by Annette's confidence in the consoling power of her words. He felt irritation being usurped by despair. To think that his mother had chosen to live among these resolute fools. What knowledge was she so determined to avoid?</p><p>'Who can say why a crematorium and a bad novel should have vaguely similar names?' said Patrick. 'It's tantalizing to be taken so far beyond the rational mind. I tell you who would be very receptive to that sort of connection: you see the old man over there with the walking stick. Do tell him. He loves that kind of thing. His name is Nick.' Patrick dimly remembered that Nicholas loathed this abbreviation.</p><p>'Seamus sends his best,' said Annette, accepting her dismissal cheerfully.</p><p>'Thank you.' Patrick bowed his head, trying not to lose control of his exaggerated deference.</p><p>What was he doing? It was all so out of date. The war with Seamus and his mother's Foundation was over. Now that he was an orphan everything was perfect. He seemed to have been waiting all his life for this sense of completeness. It was all very well for the Oliver Twists of this world, who started out in the enviable state it had taken him forty-five years to achieve, but the relative luxury of being brought ...</p></p><h2>Where People Feast: An Indigenous People&#39;s Cookbook</h2><p><p>The food traditions of North America&#x2019;s indigenous peoples are centuries old and they endure to this day.

She lives in Cambridge.A candid, intelligent and insightful portrayal of the sadomasochistic personality, Diski's sexually explicit first novel may nevertheless offend readers of delicate sensibilities. Diski describes the three-year relationship between Rachel Kee, a 31-year-old London divorcee with a young daughter, and Joshua Abelman, her superficially charming but coldly manipulative, cruelly domineering lover. To her bewilderment and shame, Joshua's brutal lovemaking fulfills a need in Rachel to be submissive and suffer pain. Their encounters are at his erratic convenience, but Rachel finds herself increasingly dependent on Joshua's presence in her life. Eventually, she suffers an acute attack of depression, is hospitalized and recovers slowly. Only then does shealmost subconsciouslyset in motion a plan to revenge herself on Joshua and break his hold on her sexual fantasies. While the sadomasochistic encounters are clearly depicted, the novel should not be considered pornographic. The character development is sensitive and psychologically sound as Diski shows how Rachel's disturbed psyche is the result of emotional damage in childhood. Although the narrative loses some momentum in the chillingly accurate but nonetheless static scenes of Rachel's depressive breakdown, on the whole this is a compelling treatment of a difficult subject.

But jewelry in Egypt is also more than mere assets, and its design and manufacture reveal a great array of styles and a high degree of skill and artistry. In this lavishly illustrated book, Azza Fahmy, herself a world-renowned designer of jewelry based on traditional motifs, lays before us an Aladdin&#x2019;s cave of jewelry made in all corners of Egypt over the last one hundred years, collected through her extensive travels throughout the country. From the farms and villages of the Nile Valley and Delta, from the oases of the Western Desert and the mountains and wadis of Sinai and the Eastern Desert, from Nubia in the south, and from the crowded traditional neighborhoods of Cairo, a cornucopia of gold and silver adornment is displayed&#x2014;each area with its own distinctive favored style. Personal seals have been widely employed, and there is even jewelry for special occasions, such as the exorcism of malignant spirits, and for animals. The author not only documents all these varieties and illustrates them with the finest examples, she also describes the techniques and skills involved in their production and the materials used, and recounts her own journey of learning as she apprenticed with the leading master jewelers to become the best known jeweler in Egypt. The author&#x2019;s work is worn by world leaders, royalty, and connoisseurs of jewelry around the globe.</p><p>AZZA FAHMY was born and raised in Sohag, in Upper Egypt.

Greenberg</strong>was honored in 1995 by the Mystery Writers of America with the Ellery Queen Award for lifetime achievement in mystery editing. He is also the recipient of two Anthony awards. <em>Mystery Scene</em> magazine called him "the best mystery anthologist since Ellery Queen." He has compiled more than 1,000 anthologies andis the president of TEKNO books.He lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin.Love and death have been twinned in the horror genre ever since Poe imagined bedding his young bride in her sepulcher by the sea. Recently, several anthologies, spearheaded by Hot Blood (1989) and its sequels, have capitalized on horror fans' taste for the eros in thanatos. Dark Love may be the strongest such book yet. The first of its 22 original tales is a raucous Stephen King entry, "Lunch at the Golden Cafe," which takes a blood-smeared butcher blade to the notion of romantic love. Similarly subversive are Richard Laymon's "The Maiden," a gleefully nasty riff on adolescent lust, and Ed Gorman's "The End of It All," in which a man's reunion with his teenage crush inspires enough plot twists to fill a novel. Not all of the stories here work well. Some, like those by David J. Schow and Ramsey Campbell, are accomplished tales but seem to have only a tangential relation to the book's theme; then there's "Locked Away," by Karl Edward Wagner, which isn't much more than a parade of pornographic images. By contrast, two of the three best stories here?Kathe Koja's "Pas de Deux" and John Peyton Cooke's daring "The Penitent" (which explores the netherland of pain and domination)?use graphic detail for provocation rather than titillation. The book's final story, Douglas Winter's "Loop," about one man's obsession with a porno star, does the same, offering an insidiously seductive conclusion to one of the finest horror collections of the year. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Death in Belmont</h2><p><p><strong>A fatal collision of three lives in the most intriguing and original crime story since <em>In Cold Blood.</em></strong></p> In the spring of 1963, the quiet suburb of Belmont, Massachusetts, is rocked by a shocking sex murder that exactly fits the pattern of the Boston Strangler. Sensing a break in the case that has paralyzed the city of Boston, the police track down a black man, Roy Smith, who cleaned the victim's house that day and left a receipt with his name on the kitchen counter. Smith is hastily convicted of the Belmont murder, but the terror of the Strangler continues.<br><br> On the day of the murder, Albert DeSalvo&#x2015;the man who would eventually confess in lurid detail to the Strangler's crimes&#x2015;is also in Belmont, working as a carpenter at the Jungers' home. In this spare, powerful narrative, Sebastian Junger chronicles three lives that collide&#x2015;and ultimately are destroyed&#x2015;in the vortex of one of the first and most controversial serial murder cases in America.</p><p>Imagine how strange and frightening it would be to see a picture of yourself, not quite a year old, with your mother and two men, one of whom is a confessed serial killer. This is what happened to Sebastian Junger, and only a small part of what he recounts in <i>A Death in Belmont</i>. <p> The quiet suburb of Belmont, Massacuusetts, is in the grip of fear. The Boston Strangler murders have taken place nearby, and now there is another shocking sex crime, right in Belmont. The victim is Bessie Goldberg, a middle-aged woman who had hired a cleaning man to help out around the house on that fall day in 1963. He is a black man named Roy Smith. He did the appointed chores, collected his money and left a receipt on the kitchen table. Neighbors will say that he looked furtive when he walked down the street, that he was in a hurry, that he stopped to buy cigarettes, that he looked over his shoulder. They didn't see a black man in Belmont very often, so, of course, they noticed him. So the story went, and on these slender threads, and his own checkered history, Roy Smith is convicted of the Belmont murder and sent to prison. </p><p> On the day of the murder, Albert DeSalvo, an Italian-American handyman, is also in Belmont, working as a carpenter in the Junger home, where the picture is taken. Two years after his work for the Jungers, he confesses in vivid detail to the crimes of which the Boston Strangler is accused, and sent to prison, where he is stabbed to death by an inmate. But he never confesses to the Bessie Goldberg murder. Could he have left the Junger home, committed the murder a few blocks away and calmly returned to finish his day's work? Could Roy Smith really have been the guilty party, even though his sentence was commuted after De Salvo confessed? </p><p> In the grand tradition of his bestselling <i>The Perfect Storm</i>, Junger tells a terrific story, lining up all the elements, asking all the pertinent questions, digging into the backgrounds of both men, retelling his mother's very strange encounter with Albert when she is home alone with Sebastian. He then asks the larger questions: Was Roy Smith convicted summarily because he was black? Was Albert De Salvo really the Boston Strangler? </p><p> Junger cannot answer all the questions, as no one can. Without DNA, there is no way to be certain of which of the two men might have committed the rape and murder of Bessie Goldberg, or if neither of them is guilty. While it is frustrating not to know for sure, the story is fascinating, reads like a tautly plotted mystery thriller, and Junger's close connection is downright creepy. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Sebastian Junger is the author of A Death in Belmont and Fire.

And it's about author Matthew Gilbert's transformation, after much fear and loathing of dogs and social groups, into one of those dog people with fur on their jackets, squeaky toys in their hands, and biscuits in their pockets.</p><p>Gilbert, longtime TV critic at <i>The Boston Globe</i>, describes his reluctant trip into the dog park subculture, as the first-time owner of a stubbornly social Yellow Lab puppy named Toby. Like many Americans, he was happily accustomed to the safe distance of TV viewing and cell-phone web surfing, tethered to the digital leash. But the headstrong, play-obsessed Toby pulls him to Amory, and Amory becomes an exhilarating dose of presence for him. The joyous chaos of wrestling dogs and the park's cast of offbeat dog owners - the "pack of freaks" - gradually draw him into the here and now. At the dog park, the dog owners go off the leash, too.</p><p>Dog-park life can be tense. When dogs fight, their owners - such as the reckless Charlotte - bare their teeth at each other, too. Amid the rollicking dog play, feelings tend to surface faster, unedited. But Gilbert shows how Amory is an idyllic microcosm, too, the home of enduring friendships and, as the droll but vulnerable Hayley knows, romantic crushes. Meeting daily, a gathering of dog owners can be like group therapy, or <i>The Office</i>, or a standup concert.</p><p>As a TV critic, Matthew Gilbert is well-known by his readership for his humorous and wry writing style. A charming narrative that will appeal to anyone who has ever enjoyed watching a puppy scamper through a park, OFF THE LEASH is a paean to dog lovers and their pets everywhere, perfect for fans of <i>Marley &amp; Me</i> and <i>Merle's Door</i>.</p></p><p>Matthew Gilbert is the TV critic at <i>The Boston Globe</i>, where he also covered books and movies. He has written for Slate, served as the managing editor of <i>Boston Review</i>, and clerked at Harvard Book Store. He lives in Brookline, Mass., and <i>Off the Leash</i> is his first book.<p>backstories</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We all land at Amory with backstories, with our particular situations, needs, and histories, and we all find something there, beyond the practicalities of getting our dogs out of the house and off the sidewalk. It&#x2019;s just a dog park, but dog parks have come to occupy a special position in modern life, as an ad hoc institution built on play, proximity, and pack relationships. We all have to interact there; our dogs make it happen. We don&#x2019;t have the protections of a PTA-like organization or the rules of sports games or the separations afforded by our cell phones; the dogs break through the padding of technology, force contact. We end up creating the tone of the outdoor community with one another on a daily basis.</p> <p>For me, the park was a megadose of presence. I was a full-on TV junkie, beginning as a kid who took his serial story lines and TV events very seriously. I remember grieving for days when Col. Henry Blake died on <i>M*A*S*H,</i> laughing out loud when Kimberly removed her wig to reveal she was a scarred madwoman on <i>Melrose Place,</i> and feeling scandalized when Sin�ad O&#x2019;Connor tore up a picture of the Pope on <i>Saturday Night Live.</i> I was four, I was eight, I was fifteen, I was sixteen, I was twenty-three, and I was forty-two and working happily as TV critic for the <i>Boston Globe,</i> and TV was my consistent and close companion. Throughout those decades, I embraced the state of electronic thrall, that pleasing equation of being there plus not being there.</p> <p>Sitting on this side of the glass, I fell in love for the first time when I was nine, in the den of our southeastern Massachusetts home. My father was long gone, that indistinct furniture salesman who&#x2019;d left me with one vague memory&#x2014;of his lifting me up to sit on a wooden desk, the lamp giving his hands a golden cast. I was watching black-and-white repeats of <i>The Dick Van Dyke Show</i> every day on TV, and secretly adopting Rob Petrie as my real dad. He was a goofy string bean of a man, an urban comedy writer with a suburban family. I loved him at age nine for his stumbles and social gaffes, for his macho-free masculinity, for the rare birds in his life, like his cowriters, Buddy and Sally, and I still do decades later. Those half hours with Rob Petrie had a religious character for me. I became one with the TV screen&#x2014;knees on the floor, elbows on a footstool facing the set, hand on chin.</p> <p>You&#x2019;ve been there, no doubt, fed by the dependable love of the remote-controlled breast. You&#x2019;ve visited that place of comfortable numbness, where the world is like another TV show. It&#x2019;s not a bad place. I lived there for years at a time, through high school and college and my twenties, perfectly content to have a screen between me and other people. I made a very satisfying career out of it. Watching TV for the <i>Globe,</i> I scribbled down endless notes, thinking about the American character as I watched the boyish Dexter kill killers or the CSIs pick through the fetishes of Las Vegas. I became well versed in the existential fears of <i>The Twilight Zone</i> and the global paranoia of <i>Lost,</i> and when I stumbled across a new TV classic, a <i>Mad Men</i> or an <i>Arrested Development,</i> I felt high.</p> <p>Sometimes, my husband, Tom, would be my TV copilot, sitting beside me in flight. He&#x2019;d generously become my partner on the couch, celebrating when the networks sent advance episodes of the great shows and suffering through a portion of the junk pile&#x2014;the shrill, idiotic sitcoms and generic cop dramas that every TV critic must sample. A political affairs guy by nature and profession, Tom nonetheless submitted to about a fourth of my viewing time (except when it came to reality TV, regarding which he told me I was on my own). And over the years, as the professional TV guy, I&#x2019;d developed elaborate viewing rituals that Tom had come to tolerate. My viewing time was sacred. He knew I needed to sit with the screen in the exact center of my field of vision. He knew I didn&#x2019;t like to answer the phone or look at the caller ID during a good show. And he knew no one in the room should talk unless the episode had been put on pause.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Toby, however, could not be put on pause. No TV, he.</p> <p>Tom and I brought Toby home in early October of 2004, a seven-week-old yellow Lab reaction ball of crazy love with baby teeth like carpet tacks. He was just perfect, with his Buddha belly, which felt like a firm down pillow. His energized little dashes and tumbles fell somewhere between acrobatics and expert slapstick comedy. Human beings practice for years to do what Toby was doing before he was even toilet-trained. He felt like a miracle to me, from top to bottom, with his daily growth spurts, his already giant paws, the softness of his ears, and his dead-on stare up at us after he dropped a toy or a stick at our feet. From the moment we got him home, I couldn&#x2019;t stop contemplating his flawlessness. I&#x2019;d say to myself, &#x201c;I have a dog named Toby,&#x201d; as if it were some kind of incantation.</p> <p>He instantly changed the layout of our third-floor Brookline walk-up&#x2014;and of our settled, professionally centered lives. We baby-gated the kitchen, and we turned the space under the small square kitchen table into a fort for one of his crates. Another crate&#x2014;yes, Toby&#x2019;s two daddies overdid it on the crate business&#x2014;took over our small bedroom. We raised all our ground-level plants, and we put musty old carpets down on our slippery wood floors so the little guy could get his footing. Tom and I stopped sleeping for a few weeks, and we both took vacation time to make sure one of us was always with him. It was not uncommon to look away and look back at a shredded document on the floor, or a pool of pee with paw prints trailing off it.</p> <p>To find my first dog, I had spent months asking friends for breeder contacts and looking online at hundreds of breeder Web sites, gawking at their photos, succumbing to their cheesy Hallmark music. I was thinking that I could somehow design my future dog&#x2019;s personality by choosing carefully. Ultimately, I landed on Mirabelle Labs, whose site was jammed with photos and dog family trees. I loved the look of the Mirabelle stock&#x2014;mid-size, a little square-headed&#x2014;and reached out to owner Dana Loud, who, after reading my application to buy one of her planned puppies, welcomed Tom and me for a visit to see her farm. Apparently, she wasn&#x2019;t scared off by my too-personal answers to her basic questions about food brands and dog safety; I&#x2019;d written out a lengthy worrywart debate with myself about whether or not it&#x2019;s okay to let a dog ride in a car with his head out the window, since there would be cars and trucks passing by. I guess she could tell that, beyond my neurosis, or because I needed to channel it productively, Tom and I were looking to take special care of a Toby.</p> <p>Visiting Dana&#x2019;s farm that spring, we met a black Lab named Mia, who, if all went according to plan and her encounter with a yellow named Drake was a success, would be the mother of our puppy. Mia was a bouncy lady who was delighted to see us, loping in circles around us as Tom and I laughed at her. Dana told us she bred for friendliness, and it was obvious she was pulling it off. Mia was one of those dogs&#x2014;Toby is, too&#x2014;who really do seem to smile at you. She smiled at us and wiggled her torso and jogged, her mostly furless belly a tad distended from previous litters, her nipples quite visible. She was irresistibly welcoming.</p> <p>&#x201c;This will be her last litter,&#x201d; Dana told us as we sat in her yard, making it all seem so much dearer.</p> <p>Tom and I felt very close during this period, just having gotten married and now preparing for our new family member. A lot of couples see puppies as rehearsals for babies; we saw our puppy as an end in himself, a cementing of our home life together. Neither one of us wanted children, a fact we&#x2019;d established early in our relationship. But we wanted mutual responsibility; we wanted to share our apartment and our love with another creature.</p> <p>We returned to Dana&#x2019;s farm five weeks after Mia had given birth, in September, to choose from the two yellows in her litter of six. I&#x2019;d told Tom I wanted to get the whitest of the yellows, because I loved fluffy whiteness, and indeed one of the two was a milky little fellow. But his slightly darker brother stole our hearts, with his strangely knowing glance, an expression Toby still gets when he&#x2019;s lazily looking our way from his comfortable couch or bed. He gazes out beneficently on the people. Inside the pen on Dana&#x2019;s thick New Hampshire grass, turning his head with its outsize snout to look straight at us while his fellow puppies slept and wrestled around him, little Toby, with his teasing eyes, said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d sure like to chase you two fellas around a dining room table&#x2014;you know you want to.&#x201d; He seemed to be quietly plotting ways to find a ball, drop it at our feet, and make us throw it. Physically, he was just this side of a guinea pig at five weeks, but he already seemed to have a fully defined personality built on jokey roguishness. He lay there staring at us on the late-summer grass, fenced in with his siblings and another litter, this one consisting of six chocolate Labs, and Tom and I were gonesville.</p> <p>In the car, I quickly said, &#x201c;I loved the yellower puppy,&#x201d; and Tom sighed.</p> <p>&#x201c;Phew. Me, too.&#x201d;</p> <p>When we picked up Toby from Dana two weeks later, we had a small crate in the backseat&#x2014;yes, another crate&#x2014;and we put him inside for the two-and-a-half-hour ride back to Boston. We didn&#x2019;t want him jumping and peeing all over the car, or getting thrown around by turns. It was his first time in a crate and in a car, and Toby began crying out immediately, making the first part of the ride, through some gorgeous early-fall New England landscapes, miserable. I couldn&#x2019;t bear his helpless wailing, which continued until he fell asleep after twenty or so endless minutes. I was sure we were scarring him for life. They weren&#x2019;t like baby cries, those alarming jolts; to my sensitive ears, they seemed to be imbued with sadness. We were traumatizing the joy out of him. We were tearing him away from his mother. I sat in the backseat, next to the crate, fretting, while Tom, who&#x2019;d had dogs almost all his life, sat at the wheel, secretly rolling his eyes at my hypersensitivity. He understood a dog&#x2019;s resilience far better than I.</p> <p>Once home, our car ride was a distant memory for Toby&#x2014;more likely, not even a memory. Toby instantly tore around the kitchen like a tiny blond tornado while we entertained him for fifteen minutes, a pattern that took hold. That first October that we had him, before the park was on the agenda, we all seemed to operate in fifteen-minute-long sessions. He&#x2019;d be the feisty ringleader for that period. He&#x2019;d pick up stuffed toys in his mouth without quite knowing what to do with them, swatting the air with his giant paws, running and looking back to make sure we were chasing him; and then&#x2014;bam&#x2014;asleep, on the spot.</p> <p>As Toby would lie snoozing, I&#x2019;d lie on my side next to him on the tile floor, staring at his perfect snout, examining its delicate geometric system of whiskers, watching his moist black nostrils flex so slightly, his eyelids flinch in dream state, his heart putter beneath his fur. I felt as though I could stare for hours, dazzled by his happy innocence, his complete unself-consciousness, his lack of impulse control. It was parenting, albeit in a different way. Knowing that he&#x2019;d wake up and see my face looming over him, and not be frightened&#x2014;it touched me. I&#x2019;d put my nose up to his belly, sniff, and smell something irresistible&#x2014;warm popcorn, maybe, or fresh promise. I felt like I could do this forever. Tom would catch me and laugh, thinking of how long I&#x2019;d resisted getting a dog. I was lying on the dirty floor, for one thing, and I was in a stupor of adoration. He saw me falling in love with Toby, and I saw him falling in love with Toby, and it was so peaceful.</p> <p>Lying there, looking at the puppy sleeping after a round of play, detached from my remote control, I already sensed that he had some kind of curative power over me, that he could somehow wake me up. This gorgeous blob of chaos was going to dominate me.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>At that time, I became obsessed with training. The assault on our daily routines was lovely, but it also sent me into recovery mode. We contacted a local guy who advertised online for home dog training and made an appointment. Don, in his twenties, with a brown shag haircut, came to our house one bright October morning, and in that hour, he told us that being firm and direct with your dog was the key to mastering him. As it turned out, we needed training, not Toby, and particularly me. After talking about how dogs want leadership, he took us down to the sidewalk for a walking session, pulling Toby forward despite Toby&#x2019;s efforts to sniff at trees and jump up at his legs. He told us that Toby&#x2019;s neck was strong, so we shouldn&#x2019;t worry about tugging on the leash for correction.</p> <p>&#x201c;Always keeps him on the same side behind you as you walk,&#x201d; Don explained.</p> <p>&#x201c;If he runs ahead of you and tries to be the leader, stop and stand in place to show him who&#x2019;s boss,&#x201d; Don advised.</p> <p>&#x201c;Always make him sit before you take off his leash,&#x201d; Don recommended.</p> <p>When Don used our dog&#x2019;s name he said &#x201c;<i>TOBY,</i>&#x201d; with authority, with not even the slightest insinuation of a question mark at the end of the word. By the end of the hour, I realized that I had to start training myself to issue commands more like an army sergeant than a plaintive friend. Mellow-voiced to the point where more than one person has suggested I go into phone sex if the whole journalism thing doesn&#x2019;t work out, I needed to make my FM radio voice heard through a haze of puppy distraction. I needed to project; the soggy bass needed to play lead. I felt like a fool talking so bossily to my dog, especially outside, when someone might hear me issuing orders, but I believed it was essential.</p> <p>Simultaneously, I was studying all the training books&#x2014;by Cesar Millan, by the Monks of New Skete&#x2014;about taking charge of your dog, who was once a wolf. They made me feel even more that I had to be commanding, or else Toby could ruin our finely tuned balance, our vertical control, our brightness, our sharpness. We were two men with demanding jobs&#x2014;I worked mostly at home; Tom went to the office&#x2014;already straining to maintain our well-earned stability. With the advent of Toby, I was scrambling to keep up with my TV shows, to have sustained thinking and writing time, to have something to say to my zeitgeist-addicted editors and to my readers about the nondoggy universe. In those first weeks and months of Tobyworld, my sense of control was under siege.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>That I was in such close proximity to a dog, even enjoying his breath on my face, was a little absurd. Here&#x2019;s the way backstory: For most of my life, I hated dogs, all dogs. I was terrified of them, so much so that I once slept in the bathroom rather than face my roommate&#x2019;s visiting dog, who waited for me outside the bathroom door, panting, barking, whining, hoping to play with a new friend. I was in college and living off campus, and my roommate was out, so I dozed sitting up, my neck against a roll of toilet paper, until she came home at four in the morning, whereupon I pretended that I just happened to be using the toilet at that moment. &#x201c;Oh, hey, good morning, good night,&#x201d; I said with blurry eyes to her and her dog, a German shepherd mix, who was now wagging his tail at her, as I walked out of the bathroom. I was afraid of things that moved quickly and unpredictably&#x2014;not just dogs, but basketballs and baseballs, speedboats, love, anything th...</p></p><h2>Whale Rescue (Secret Mermaid)</h2><p>The whales are missing from the Undersea Kingdom so Molly and her mermaid friend, Leila, set out to find them.

Into the Valley remains powerful, achieving a rare sense of immediacy in depicting life and death in wartime. The military action itself is easily understood: the American unit walked into a trap, overcame initial panic and withdrew under fire. But the facts are of the least interest in this rivetting narrative. Instead, readers will find themselves drawn to Hersey's expert rendering of the soldiers' reactions--facial expressions, gestures, dialogue--while weathering a state of duress, and his impressive chronicling of their transition from youthful cocksureness to terror. For his own part, the author was anything but confident; "miserably green," he released tension by "ridiculously tearing very big leaves into very small pieces." Hersey has made only minor revisions in this new edition, and he confesses to embarrassment over his original softening of Marine expletives and comments about "Japs." <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Naoki Urasawa&#39;s 20th Century Boys, Vol. 17 (17)</h2><p>This is the story of a group of boys who try to save the world!

This controversial best-selling expos� of the Psychology Industry was first published in 1996. Now available in its revised, updated and less expensive 3rd edition, it is no less popular nor less explosive than when it first appeared. Cited in Time and the New York Times, among other wide-circulation publications, Tana Dineen&#39;s scathing attack on the abuses and misuses of corrupted psychotherapy is a must read for care-givers and care-takers alike. And for would-be care-takers too. Topics covered include Victim-Making, Fabricated Victims, Selling Psychology as a Science, The Business of Psychology, The Technology of Victim-Making, The Rise to Power of the Psychology Industry, and Living in the Shadow of the Psychology Industry. Fully supported by end of book notes and index, and with a suggested reading list, this is one of the most important books on psychology to appear in recent years. The author has been often--and always unsuccessfully--attacked by representatives of corporate psychology who have resorted to character assassination rather than reason to try and prove Dr. Dineen wrong.</p><p>Psychology is an influential and accepted force in our culture. It has become a kind of industry that generates a great deal of money for its practitioners -- sometimes at the expense of the patient. Manufacturing Victims: What The Psychology Industry Is Doing To People describes the various types of psychological techniques and assumptions that create and cater to "victims", often to the damage of the patient, the division of families, the distortion of justice, the destruction of businesses, and the weakening of the nation. Individual chapters address Victim Making; Fabricated Victims; The Growth of the Psychology Industry; Selling Psychology as Science; The Business of Psychology; The Technology of Victim Making; and Talking Back Our Private Lives. Manufacturing Victims is a serious and long needed assessment of what is happening with increasing frequency in this lucrative and widespread area of mental health services. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>John Brown, Rose and the Midnight Cat</h2><p>Rose&#39;s dog feels he can look after her without any help from a cat but Rose has different ideas.</p><p></p><h2>A Divided Command (John Pearce, 10)</h2><p>Unbeknown to John Pearce, the private letter he is delivering on behalf of the prime minister carries the dismissal of the very man he is sailing to see.

(<i>Historical Novels Review</i>)</p><h2>A Christmas Garland: A Novel</h2><p>&#x201c;An annual treat,&#x201d; declared <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> of Anne Perry&#x2019;s Victorian-era holiday mysteries. Now she continues this magnificent tradition with <i>A Christmas Garland, </i>a yuletide tale set in exotic India. This time the mistress of mystery tells the story of a terrible crime that sets the stage for another: accusing an innocent man of murder.<br> &nbsp;<br> The year is 1857, soon after the violent Siege of Cawnpore, with India in the midst of rebellion. In the British garrison, a guard is killed and an Indian prisoner escapes, which leads to yet more British deaths. Cries for revenge are overwhelming. Despite no witnesses and no evidence against him, a luckless British medical orderly named John Tallis is arrested as an accomplice simply because he was the only soldier unaccounted for when these baffling crimes were committed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though chosen to defend Tallis, young Lieutenant Victor Narraway is not encouraged to try very hard. Narraway&#x2019;s superiors merely want a show trial. But inspired by a soldier&#x2019;s widow and her children, and by his own stubborn faith in justice, Narraway searches for the truth. In an alien world haunted by memories of massacre, he is the accused man&#x2019;s only hope.<br> &nbsp;<br> The trial of John Tallis equals the white-knuckle best of Anne Perry&#x2019;s breathtaking courtroom dramas. And thanks to a simple Christmas garland and some brilliant detective work, Narraway perseveres against appalling odds, learning how to find hope within himself&#x2014;and turn the darkest hour into one full of joy and light.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>PRAISE FOR THE CHRISTMAS NOVELS OF ANNE PERRY</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>A Christmas Homecoming</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Could have been devised by Agatha Christie . . .

Anne Perry lives in Scotland.Lieutenant Victor Narraway walked across the square in the cool evening air. It was mid-December, a couple of weeks before Christmas. At home in England it might already be snowing, but here in India there would not even be a frost. No one had ever seen snow in Cawnpore. Any other year it would be a wonderful season: one of rejoicing, recalling happy memories of the past, and looking forward to the future, perhaps with a little nostalgia for those loved ones who were far away.<br><br>But this year of 1857 was different. The fire of mutiny had scorched across the land, touching everything with death.<br><br>He came to the outer door of one of the least-damaged parts of the barracks and knocked. Immediately it was opened and he stepped inside. Oil lamps sent a warming yellow light over the battered walls and the few remnants of the once-secure occupation, as they had been before the siege and then its relief. There was little furniture left whole: a bullet-scarred desk, three chairs that had seen better days, a bookcase and several cupboards, one with only half a door.<br><br>Colonel Latimer was standing in the middle of the room. He was a tall and spare man well into his forties; a dozen Indian summers had burned his skin brown, but there was little color beneath it to alleviate the weariness and the marks of exhaustion. He regarded the twenty-year-old lieutenant in front of him with something like an apologetic look.<br><br>&#x201c;I have an unpleasant duty for you, Narraway,&#x201d; he said quietly. &#x201c;It must be done, and done well. You&#x2019;re new to this regiment, but you have an excellent record. You are the right man for this job.&#x201d;<br><br>Narraway felt a chill, in spite of the mild evening. His father had purchased a commission for him, and he had served a brief training in England before being sent out to India. He had arrived a year ago, just before the issue of the fateful cartridges at Dum Dum in January, which later in the spring had erupted in mutiny. The rumor had been that the bullets were coated with animal grease, in the part required to be bitten into in order to open the cartridge for use. The Hindus had been told it was beef fat. Cows were sacred, and to kill one was blasphemy. To put cow fat to the lips was damnation. The Muslims had been told it was pork fat, and to them, the pig was an unclean animal. To put that grease to your lips would damn your soul, although for an entirely different reason.<br><br>Of course, that was not the only cause of the mutiny by hundreds of thousands of Indians against the rule of a few thousand Englishmen employed by the East India Company. The reasons were more complex, far more deeply rooted in the social inequities and the cultural offenses of a foreign rule. The bullets had merely been the spark that had ignited the fire.<br><br>Also it was true, as far as Narraway could gather, that the mutiny was far from universal. It was violent and terrible only in small parts of the country. Thousands of miles remained untouched by it, lying peaceful, if a little uneasy, under the winter sun. But the province of Sind on the Hindustan plains had seen much of the very worst of it, Cawnpore and Lucknow in particular.<br><br>General Colin Campbell, a hero from the recent war in the Crimea, had fought to relieve the siege at Luck�now. A week ago he and his men had defeated 25,000 rebels here at Cawnpore. Was it the beginning of a turning of the tide? Or just a glimmer of light that would not last?<br><br>Narraway stood to attention, breathing deeply to calm himself. Why had he come to Latimer&#x2019;s notice?<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; he said between his teeth.<br><br>Latimer smiled bleakly. There was no light in his face, no warmth of approval. &#x201c;You will be aware of the recent escape of the prisoner Dhuleep Singh,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;And that his guard, Chuttur Singh, was hacked to death in the course of Dhuleep&#x2019;s escape?&#x201d;<br><br>Narraway&#x2019;s mouth was dry. Of course he knew it; everyone in the Cawnpore station knew it.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; he said obediently, forcing the words out.<br><br>&#x201c;It has been investigated.&#x201d; Latimer&#x2019;s jaw was tight, and a small muscle jumped in his temple. &#x201c;We know Dhuleep Singh had privileged information regarding troop movements, specifically regarding the recent patrol that was massacred. We also know the man could not have escaped without assistance.&#x201d; His voice was growing quieter, as if he found the words more and more difficult to say. He cleared his throat with an effort. &#x201c;Our inquiries have excluded every possibility except that he was helped by Corporal John Tallis, the medical orderly.&#x201d; He met Narraway&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;We will try him the day after tomorrow. I require you to speak in his defense.&#x201d;<br><br>Narraway&#x2019;s mind whirled. There was a chill like ice in the pit of his stomach. A score of reasons leaped to his mind why he could not do what Latimer was asking of him. He was not even remotely equal to the task. It would be so much better to have one of the officers who had been with the regiment during the siege and the relief do it, someone who knew everyone. Above all, they should have an officer who was experienced in military law, who had defended men dozens of times and was known and respected by the regiment.<br><br>Then a cold, sane voice inside assured him that it was precisely because he was none of these things that Latimer had chosen him.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; he said faintly.<br><br>&#x201c;Major Strafford will be here any moment,&#x201d; Latimer continued. &#x201c;He will give you any instruction and advice that you may need. I shall be presiding over the court, so it is not appropriate that I should do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Narraway said again, feeling as if another nail had been driven into the coffin lid of his career. Major Strafford&#x2019;s dislike of him dated back to the time before he had joined the regiment. Almost certainly it stemmed from Narraway&#x2019;s brief acquaintance with Strafford&#x2019;s younger brother. They had been in the same final year at Eton, and little about their association had been happy.<br><br>Narraway had been academic, a natural scholar and disinclined toward sports. The younger Strafford was a fine athlete but no competition for Narraway in the classroom. They existed happily enough in a mutual contempt. It was shattered one summer evening in a magnificent cricket match, nail-bitingly close, with Strafford&#x2019;s team having the slight edge&#x2014;until Narraway showed a rare flash of brilliance in the only sport he actually enjoyed. The dark, slender scholar, without a word spoken, bowled out the last three men on Strafford&#x2019;s team, including the great sportsman himself. The fact that he did it with apparent ease was appalling, but that he did not overtly take any pleasure in it was unforgivable.<br><br>And Strafford Minor had never been able to exact his revenge on the field, which was the only place he could redeem his honor. Other victories did not count. And practical jokes or barbed wit looked to be nothing more than the spite of a bad loser.<br><br>But that was boyhood, two years ago and thousands of miles away.<br><br>&#x201c;Captain Busby will prosecute,&#x201d; Latimer was going on. &#x201c;The evidence seems simple enough. You will be free to interview Corporal Tallis at any time you wish, and anyone else you feel could be helpful to your defense. If there are any legal points that you need to clarify, speak to Major Strafford.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Narraway was still at attention, his muscles aching with the effort of keeping complete control of himself.<br><br>There was a brief knock on the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Come,&#x201d; Latimer ordered.<br><br>The door swung open and Major Strafford came in. He was a tall, handsome man in his early thirties, but the echo of Narraway&#x2019;s schoolfellow, so much his junior, was there in the set of his shoulders, the thick, fair hair, the shape of his jaw.<br><br>Strafford glanced at Latimer.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir.&#x201d; He saluted, then, as he was given permission, relaxed. He regarded Narraway expressionlessly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better read up on the case tonight and start questioning people tomorrow morning,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You need to be sure of the law. We don&#x2019;t want anyone afterward saying that we cut corners. I presume you appreciate that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Narraway heard the edge of condescension in Strafford&#x2019;s voice and would dearly like to have told him that he was as aware as anyone else of how they would all be judged on their conduct in the matter. More than that, the future of British rule in India would be flavored by reports of decisions such as this. The whole structure of Empire hung together on the belief in justice, in doing things by immutable rules and a code of honor that they themselves never broke.<br><br>Thousands of men were dead already, as well as women and children. If the British ever regained control and there was to be any kind of peace, it must be under the rule of law. It was the only safety for people of any color or faith. Otherwise there was no hope left for anyone. Right now there seemed to be little enough in any circumstances. Delhi had fallen, Lucknow, Agra, Jhelum, Sugauli, Dinapoor, Lahore, Kolapore, Ramgarh, Peshawar&#x2014;and on and on. The list seemed endless.<br><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Strafford said curtly. &#x201c;Whatever you think you know, you&#x2019;d better come and see me and tell me at least the outline of your defense.&#x201d; He looked at Narraway closely, his blue eyes curiously luminous in the light of the oil lamp. &#x201c;You must be sure to mount some defense&#x2014;you do understand that, don&#x2019;t you? At least put forward a reason why a man like Tallis should betray the men he&#x2019;s served beside all his career. I know he&#x2019;s a quarter Indian, or something of the sort, but that&#x2019;s no excuse.&#x201d;</p><h2>NRA: An American Legend</h2><p>The history of the National Rifle Association explores the right of Americans to keep and bear arms from its inception in New York city in 1871 to the present.</p><p>Jeff was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota and grew up in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, which accounts for an early interest in outdoor sports.

Hundreds of women wrote to her to say that the book had transformed, even saved, their lives. Nearly half a century later, many women still recall where they were when they first read it.In A Strange Stirring, historian Stephanie Coontz examines the dawn of the 1960s, when the sexual revolution had barely begun, newspapers advertised for perky, attractive gal typists, but married women were told to stay home, and husbands controlled almost every aspect of family life. Based on exhaustive research and interviews, and challenging both conservative and liberal myths about Friedan, A Strange Stirring brilliantly illuminates how a generation of women came to realize that their dissatisfaction with domestic life didn t reflect their personal weakness but rather a social and political injustice.</p><p><b>Stephanie Coontz</b> teaches history and family studies at Evergreen State College. Her books include <i>Marriage, a History</i>, <i>The Way We Never Were</i>, and <i>The Way We Really Are</i>. She lives in Olympia, Washington.&#x201c;As was written about <i>The</i><i>Feminine Mystique</i>, <i>A Strange Stirring</i> is &#x2018;a journalistic tour de force, combining scholarship, investigative reporting and a compelling personal voice.&#x2019; Stephanie Coontz has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the most transformative movement of our lifetimes. Much of what Coontz reports regarding the prevailing ethos of the 1950s as a time of conformity, cultural conservatism and social repressiveness will be fascinating and eye-opening for younger readers. This book is a must read for men as well as for women. And the transformational desire for a work/family balance in life is now reflected not just by gender, but by generation, as both men and women &#x2018;need to grow and fulfill their potentialities as human beings,&#x2019; as Friedan wrote almost a half a century ago.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>Elizabeth Gilbert, author of&nbsp;<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i></b>&nbsp;<br><br><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><i><br></i>&#x201c;[A] timely contribution to the conversation about what constitutes progress for women (and for which women) in these days of mommy wars and mama grizzlies....

In her new book, <i>A Strange Stirring</i>, she chronicles the untold story of some of America&#x2019;s greatest pioneers.

Although Friedan claimed credit for initiating the modern feminist movement, Coontz places the book more dispassionately in its historical context as one of many factors working against entrenched gender roles. Still, Coontz demonstrates persuasively that women readers from many backgrounds found relief&#x2014;some called it life-saving&#x2014;in knowing that they were not crazy and not alone in their need to find some work independent of their family roles.&#x201d;<i><br></i><b>Donna L.

Weaving a rich fabric from what women said in letters and interviews, from articles in popular magazines, current scholarship, and her own astute reading of the 1963 work, Coontz compellingly reveals how generations of women&#x2014;from the flappers of the 1920s to the bloggers and helicopter moms of today&#x2014;have responded to the challenges modern women face.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>Christie Hefner, former chairman and chief executive officer of Playboy Enterprises and longest serving female C.E.O. of a U.S. public company</b><br><br><b>Michelle Goldberg, <i>The New Republic<br></i></b>&#x201c;Coontz recounts the catalytic effect that <i>The Feminine Mystique</i> had on a great many women.

But <i>The Feminine Mystique </i>is not just an artifact of a benighted era. It still contains important lessons about one of the most important questions of all, which is how to create a meaningful, autonomous life.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Women&#x2019;s Review of Books<br></i></b>&#x201c;Nearly fifty years after <i>The Feminine Mystique</i> exploded onto the scene, Stephanie Coontz measures Friedan&#x2019;s outsized reputation against a revealing body of research gleaned from archival sources, oral interviews, and surveys she conducted with nearly 200 women. The result is a brisk, even-handed account of the book&#x2019;s literary achievements, political limitations, and enduring legacy.... Coontz sheds new light on Friedan&#x2019;s savvy as both a writer and an activist.

What he discovers is unimaginable: a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church by a centuries-old underground organization - the Illuminati. Desperate to save the Vatican from a powerful time bomb, Langdon joins forces in Rome with the beautiful and mysterious scientist Vittoria Vetra. Together they embark on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and the most secretive vault on earth . . . the long-forgotten Illuminati lair.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>It takes guts to write a novel that combines an ancient secret brotherhood, the Swiss Conseil Europ�en pour la Recherche Nucl�aire, a papal conclave, mysterious ambigrams, a plot against the Vatican, a mad scientist in a wheelchair, particles of antimatter, jets that can travel 15,000 miles per hour, crafty assassins, a beautiful Italian physicist, and a Harvard professor of religious iconology. It takes talent to make that novel anything but ridiculous. Kudos to Dan Brown (<i>Digital Fortress</i>) for achieving the nearly impossible. Angels &amp; Demons is a no-holds-barred, pull-out-all-the-stops, breathless tangle of a thriller--think Katherine Neville's <i>The Eight</i> (but cleverer) or Umberto Eco's <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i> (but more accessible). <p></p> Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is shocked to find proof that the legendary secret society, the Illuminati--dedicated since the time of Galileo to promoting the interests of science and condemning the blind faith of Catholicism--is alive, well, and murderously active. Brilliant physicist Leonardo Vetra has been murdered, his eyes plucked out, and the society's ancient symbol branded upon his chest. His final discovery, antimatter, the most powerful and dangerous energy source known to man, has disappeared--only to be hidden somewhere beneath Vatican City on the eve of the election of a new pope. Langdon and Vittoria, Vetra's daughter and colleague, embark on a frantic hunt through the streets, churches, and catacombs of Rome, following a 400-year-old trail to the lair of the Illuminati, to prevent the incineration of civilization. <p></p> Brown seems as much juggler as author--there are lots and lots of balls in the air in this novel, yet Brown manages to hurl the reader headlong into an almost surreal suspension of disbelief. While the reader might wish for a little more sardonic humor from Langdon, and a little less bombastic philosophizing on the eternal conflict between religion and science, these are less fatal flaws than niggling annoyances--readers should have no trouble skimming past them and immersing themselves in a heck of a good read. "Brain candy" it may be, but my!

Why was pork considered unclean and forbidden? What is the cultural significance of the golden calf? These and many more questions arise as we read the first five books of the Old Testament. But the answers won't be found merely by searching the text more carefully. They call for knowledge apart from the text of Scripture. They summon us to investigate the world of the Bible that lies outside the Bible. It is a world that the original readers of Genesis, Exodus and the other books would have been very familiar with, a world that would have required little extra explanation for them. But few of us, now centuries removed from the time of the books' first writing, are equipped for such understanding. Fortunately in recent decades much has been learned of that distant and ancient Near Eastern world. But much of that knowledge is still "locked up" in archaeological studies and academic texts to which scholars alone hold the keys. In <em>The IVP Bible Background Commentary: Genesis--Deuteronomy,</em> John Walton and Victor Matthews make accessible to us the results of extensive historical and cultural investigation and then apply it toward our understanding of each passage of the Pentateuch. Like its predecessor, the bestselling <em>IVP Bible Background Commentary: New Testament</em>, this work is a "must have" for every student of the Bible. Pastors, teachers, Sunday-school teachers, college and seminary students, and everyday readers of the Bible will find it a priceless and constant companion to their study and reading of these five foundational books of the Old Testament.</p><p>Walton is professor of Old Testament at Wheaton College Graduate School (beginning Fall 2001). Previously he was professor of Old Testament and Hebrew at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois. His several books on the Old Testament include Ancient Israelite Literature in Its Cultural Context, Chronological and Background Charts of the Old Testament and (with Andrew E. Hill) A Survey of the Old Testament. <p>About the author Matthews is professor of religion at Southwest Missouri State University. He has written several books on the Old Testament, including Manners and Customs in the Bible: An Illustrated Guide to Life in Bible Times, (with James Moyer) The Old Testament: Text and Context and (with Don C. Benjamin) The Social World of Ancient Israel.</p></p><h2>Inheriting the Trade: A Northern Family Confronts Its Legacy as the Largest Slave-Trading Dynasty in U.S. History</h2><p>In 2001, at forty-seven, Thomas DeWolf was astounded to discover that he was related to the most successful slave-trading family in American history, responsible for transporting at least 10,000 Africans to the Americas. His infamous ancestor, U.S. senator James DeWolf of Bristol, Rhode Island, curried favor with President Thomas Jefferson to continue in the trade after it was outlawed. When James DeWolf died in 1837, he was the second-richest man in America.<br><br>When Katrina Browne, Thomas DeWolf's cousin, learned about their family's history, she resolved to confront it head-on, producing and directing a documentary feature film, <i>Traces of the Trade: A Story from the Deep North.</i> The film is an official selection of the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. <br><br><i>Inheriting the Trade</i> is Tom DeWolf's powerful and disarmingly honest memoir of the journey in which ten family members retraced the steps of their ancestors and uncovered the hidden history of New England and the other northern states. <br><br>Their journey through the notorious Triangle Trade-from New England to West Africa to Cuba-proved life-altering, forcing DeWolf to face the horrors of slavery directly for the first time. It also inspired him to contend with the complicated legacy that continues to affect black and white Americans, Africans, and Cubans today. <br><br><i>Inheriting the Trade</i> reveals that the North's involvement in slavery was as common as the South's. Not only were black people enslaved in the North for over two hundred years, but the vast majority of all slave trading in America was done by northerners. Remarkably, half of all North American voyages involved in the slave trade originated in Rhode Island, and all the northern states benefited. <br><br>With searing candor, DeWolf tackles both the internal and external challenges of his journey-writing frankly about feelings of shame, white male privilege, the complicity of churches, America's historic amnesia regarding slavery-and our nation's desperate need for healing. An urgent call for meaningful and honest dialogue, <i>Inheriting the Trade</i> illuminates a path toward a more hopeful future and provides a persuasive argument that the legacy of slavery isn't merely a southern issue but an enduring American one.</p><p>Thomas Norman DeWolf was born in California and educated at the University of Oregon. He served as city councilor, county commissioner, and for nine years on the Oregon Arts Commission. His years of public service focused on literacy, children&#39;s issues, and restorative justice. A member of the Pacific Northwest Writers Association, he lives with his wife in Oregon.When a cousin decided to make a documentary about the DeWolf family's slave-trading past, Thomas Norman DeWolf joined several family members on a journey to retrace the routes of his family's slave ships from Ghana to Cuba and the United States. DeWolf's voice reflects his admitted na�vet�--at times too much so--as he discusses his growing awareness and shame over ancestor James DeWolf's role in the Triangle Trade. The author's descriptions of the places and history he discovered along the journey are powerful, and the topic is both compelling and important. However, the personal angle--the making of the documentary and the family discussions--distracts at times from the listener's understanding of and coming to terms with the horrors of the slave trade. J.A.S. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Robert Frost: The Poet as Philosopher</h2><p>Robert Frost is by far the most celebrated major American poet of the twentieth century. In part, this is because his poetry seems, on the surface, to be so accessible, even homey. But Frost was not just a powerful writer of popular lyric and narrative verse, argues Peter J. Stanlis in this major contribution to American literary study and philosophy. Rather, his work is deeply rooted in a complex philosophical dualism that opposes both idealistic monism, centered in spirit, and scientific positivism, which posits that the universe can be understood as nothing but matter.&nbsp;In <i>Robert Frost: The Poet as Philosopher,</i> Stanlis shows how Frost&#x2019;s philosophical dualism of spirit and matter is perceived through metaphors and applied to science, religion, art, education, and society. He further argues that Frost&#x2019;s dualism provides a critique of the monistic forces that were instrumental in the triumph of twentieth-century totalitarianism. Thoroughly informed by his twenty-three year friendship and correspondence with Frost, Stanlis&#x2019;s landmark volume is the first attempt to deal with the poet&#x2019;s philosophy in a systematic manner. It will appeal not only to fans of Frost but to all who understand poetry as a form of revelation for understanding human nature.</p><p>Peter J. Stanlis is Distinguished Professor of Humanities, Emeritus, at Rockford College. The author of <i>Edmund Burke and the Natural Law,</i> which appeared in 1955 and revolutionized the way Burke was viewed by scholars, he promised Frost in 1944 that he would someday write the best book about Frost&#x2019;s art and thought that he had it in him to write. Stanlis&#x2019;s previous monograph on Frost is titled <i>Robert Frost: The Individual and Society.</i>"Making good use of his decades-long friendship and correspondence with Frost, Stanlis traces Frost's influences and his approach to such thinkers as Darwin, the Huxleys, Lovejoy, Einstein, and innovators in disciplines ranging from the arts to education. This is essential reading for both scholars and students."<b>&#x2014;</b><i><i>Book News</i></i><br><br><br>"Stanlis does not contend that Frost was a systematic philosopher....Rather he depicts him as someone who starts with certain perceptions about reality, a series of insights that he seeks to confirm through study and conversation and which he puts into verse that would become an honored part of the American literary heritage."<b>&#x2014;</b><i>Society Magazine</i><br><br>"Stanlis, who knew and spoke with Frost on and off between 1939 and the poet&#x2019;s death...is best known as the formidable scholar of 18th-century literature whose Edmund Burke and the Natural Law (1958) revolutionized our understanding of Burke. Now, in Robert Frost: The Poet as Philosopher, he has performed a similar task, producing a book that may well reshape our understanding of Frost....Amply footnoted, and buttressed by an impressive bibliography of secondary sources, <i>Robert Frost: The Poet as Philosopher</i> offers much-needed clarity on a man whose life and work have been too long shrouded in confusion. Stanlis has produced a landmark work that will prove essential to future readers who seek to understand Robert Frost."<b>&#x2014;</b> James E.

Partridge is to pear tree as firefly is to fir tree in Knight's sweet-as-a-candy cane spin on "The Twelve Days of Christmas," starring two true-love mice, Max and Maude, in the throes of holiday preparations and gift giving. First published in 1963, the illustrated "carol for mice" is here reissued with new, enlarged, full-color paintings, most presented as separate, titled visual vignettes pinned up on a bulletin board. The verses here echo the originals: five golden rings become five golden bells, six geese a-laying become six wrens a-nesting, but most, from crickets to "nine nuts for nibbling" reflect a natural, mouse-centric world. The book's charm lies in the contagious exuberance of Maude and Max and their inventive gifts, from two silver pins (to use as chopsticks) to "seven spiders spinning" spelling out the word "joy" in a web. In the end, every nook and cranny of the mouse house of found objects is happily humming with bees, tree frogs, and wrens, all having as much fun as the mice.

Her family included a sister, Frances, and a brother, John. From the age of five, she dreamed of becoming an author. She wrote stories for her Grandfather Carpenter, and each Christmas she gave him one of these stories as a gift. Today, Ms. Warner is best remembered as the author of The Boxcar Children Mysteries.In this bare-bones graphic-novel adaptation of a Boxcar Children story, the Alden children move with their grandfather into a lighthouse and are given cause to wonder about a local fisherman&#x2019;s son as well as what is disturbing their own dog in the nighttime. Awkward art dangles the children&#x2019;s expressions between manga and unexplained sadness, while the original independence of the foursome in the text novels is undercut by Grandfather&#x2019;s regular interventions here. The attraction of a dependable cast and comfortable pacing makes this good for collections where the series has gained popularity.

Michael Gray eschews the dispassionate voice typical of reference books for a highly opinionated take on his muse's work.

Also included is a CD-ROM with a searchable PDF of the entire book.MICHAEL GRAY is a distinguished critic, writer &amp;broadcaster. He graduated in History &amp;English Literature at York University, England, in the 1960s, where he studied under the controversial, brilliant critic Professor F. R. Leavis, and where as a student journalist he interviewed, among others, the eminent British historian A. J. P. Taylor and the legendary American guitarist Jimi Hendrix. His pioneering study of Bob Dylan's work, Song &amp;Dance Man, first published in the 1970s in Britain, America and Japan, was the first full-length critical study of this crucial 20th Century cultural figure. It is now recognised as a classic in its field. A selection of pieces on Dylan, All Across The Telegraph: A Bob Dylan Handbook, published in 1987, was co-edited by Gray and included work by several distinguished academics in the fields of English &amp;American Literature and Music. In 1996, Michael Gray co-authored The Elvis Atlas: A Journey Through Elvis Presley's America, published in hardback in New York by Henry Holt. The massive Song &amp;Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan was published by Continuum in March 2000. A special reprint appeared in the US in April 2001, when Gray delivered talks at a number of US universities; a fourth reprint was published in New York and London in 2002 and a fifth in 2004. Michael Gray is recognised as a world authority on the work of Bob Dylan and is an expert on rock'n'roll history and the blues, with a special interest in pre-war blues.

It is through an imagined woman&#39;s eyes that the authors and the reader see and are affected by the religious sites and rituals of Rome 1300 (e.g., the night-long procession of the icon of Christ from the Lateran to join the icon of Mary at S. Maria Maggiore across the city). The purpose of the book is to present medieval Rome as a living environment, to show how the major churches and the sacred relics, frescoes, icons, and mosaics within them actually served in the Middle Ages to attract the faithful and to confirm and teach belief among the throngs of pilgrims who flocked to the eternal city. The authors not only look back at what pilgrims ventured to see in Rome during the first Jubilee but forward to the Holy Year of 2000, when an estimated 45 million Catholics will retrace the steps of their forebears in search of plenary absolution.</p><p>Colleagues at Johns Hopkins University, Kessler and Zacharias have composed a book, focusing on some of the chief churches in Rome, that has a unique premise: accompanying a woman on her religious pilgrimage through Rome in August 1300, the year Pope Boniface VIII proclaimed the Church's first Year of Jubilee. The authors present scenes of still-standing church buildings and their interiors as they were in 1300, and they have reconstructed scenes of the apostolic basilicas (e.g., St. Peter and St. Paul Outside the Walls), which predate the present churches. Besides thoroughly treating the four patriarchal basilicas, the authors superbly display two very important and sometimes overlooked churches in the city: San Clemente and Santa Prassede. The authors, who are more expert at theology than art, have produced a book well worth taking along to Rome for the millennial Holy Year. The book is recommended for all libraries with an interest in Christian church architecture and art.<br><i>-David I. Fulton Coll. of Saint Elizabeth, Morristown, NJ </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.According to Kessler and Zacharias, the Jubilee or Holy Year remains one of the church's most spiritually, politically, and economically consequential traditions. Promising plenary absolution (forgiveness for a lifetime of sins) for all those who journeyed to Rome, Pope Boniface VIII instituted the first Jubilee in 1300. Lured by the pope's unprecedented guarantee of exoneration, more than 200,000 pilgrims flocked to the Eternal City to cleanse their troubled souls. With medieval Rome as a vibrant backdrop, the authors conduct a guided tour of the path taken and the sites visited by a typical pilgrim in 1300. Vivid descriptions and illustrations of churches, sacred relics, precious works of art, and architectural gems are provided; moreover, the spiritual significance of these locations, objects, and buildings is analyzed in depth. A stunning historical blueprint of Rome and its holy sites. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He died in 1928Hearkening back to the Wessex of an earlier Napoleonic period, Hardy&#39;s novel creates a homely world of likeable, though sometimes dull folk, anxious to get on with the business of falling in love despite the threat of imminent landing by the French. With a seemingly infinite range of voices Benjamin Whitrow recreates each of them as only this trained English actor could. Hardy and Whitrow combine to create a world of charming local types: the gentle miller and his two sons; the crude but scheming Festus Derriman and his delightfully miserly uncle, old farmer Derriman; and the beautiful object of all their attentions, sweet Anne Garland. For readers used to Hardy&#39;s star-crossed characters, this romance is a delightful discovery. P.A.J.

Based on the writings of explorers, missionaries, scientists, and adventurers over the past 200 years, the authors have pieced together exciting and informative glimpses into the lives of these legless giants. Included are chapters on where they are found (often around human habitations), what they eat (includes crocodiles, deer, and cows), how big do they really get (a controversial subject), attacks on humans (rare), exploitation by humans for their skins, and conservation. The book is illustrated with photos, historical lithographs, maps, and graphs.</p><p>Murphy (Field Museum, Chicago) and Henderson (curator of herpetology, Milwaukee Museum) scrutinize hundreds of published encounters between large snakes and humans in an attempt to learn more about how these animals live in their natural habitat. Comparing what is known about captive pythons and anacondas with the information reported, the authors strive to separate truth from exaggeration. Excerpted accounts fill the pages and include newspaper articles, adventure writings, and reports of early explorers. Through these accounts, the reader shares the wonder and terror of wild encounters with these tremendous reptiles. One's reaction is not diminished by the authors' correcting of inaccuracies and exaggerations. They make clear that large snakes are interesting in a zoo but awesome in their native environment.

Drawing on the cutting edge of modern scholarship, authors Tim Freke and Peter Gandy present overwhelming evidence that the Jesus of the New Testament is a mythical figure.<br><br>Far from being eyewitness accounts, as is traditionally held, the Gospels are actually Jewish adaptations of ancient Pagan myths of the dying and resurrecting godman Osiris-Dionysus. The supernatural story of Jesus is not the history of a miraculous Messiah, but a carefully crafted spiritual allegory designed to guide initiates on a journey of mystical discovery.<br><br>A little more than a century ago most people believed that the strange story of Adam and Eve was history; today it is understood to be a myth. Within a few decades, Freke and Gandy argue, we will likewise be amazed that the fabulous story of God incarnate -- who was born of a virgin, who turned water into wine, and who rose from the dead -- could have been interpreted as anything but a profound parable.</p><p>&#x201c;A wonderful blend of detective story, historical research, and clear thinking, <b>The Jesus Mysteries</b> explains in accessible form what has been known to scholars for centuries.

This book demonstrates, however, that Obama in reality helped to institutionalize a permanent warfare state that resulted in gross human rights violations and contributed to America's strategic decline. His perpetuation of the War on Terror created more enemies and prompted the United States to lose influence in the Middle East. His Pivot to Asia policy intensified prospects for regional war while his unnecessary and willful military intervention destroyed Libya and drew the Russians in to protect Bashir al-Assad who won Syria's civil war. The Obama administration's heavy-handed interference in Ukraine led to effective Russian counter-moves, promoting a strategic alliance with China and regional integration that is moving the world towards multi-polarity.<br><br>Obama's Unending Wars provides the first critical, comprehensive and highly documented history of the foreign policy of America's forty-fourth president - the drone king who ordered the bombing of seven Muslim countries, backtracked on a pledge to reduce America's nuclear arsenal, and helped fuel a new Cold War with Russia. During his years in office Obama provided billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia as it assisted in the crushing of pro-democracy demonstrators in Bahrain and invaded Yemen. He sanctioned a coup in Honduras which plunged that country into chaos, perpetuated a failed drug war policy and contributed to the recolonization of Africa. <br><br>While any Democratic Party president would have faced peril in confronting the Pentagon which had carried out a slow coup d'etat over the decades, Obama was rather, in many ways, the most perfect spokesman for the military-industrial complex. Who else but this articulate constitutional law professor could pull off a pro-war speech after winning the Nobel Peace Prize while ramping up drone assassinations and America's network of military bases in Africa and still retain the support of liberal-progressives?<br><br>As many in the time of Trump now glance nostalgically back to the Obama presidency, this book will help them to see the continuity -- and continuous failure -- of American foreign policy irrespective of the party or figurehead representing it.</p><p>JEREMY KUZMAROV is author of three previous books on U.S. foreign policy:The Russians are Coming, Again: The First Cold War as Tragedy, the Second as Farce, with John Marciano; Modernizing Repression: Police Training and Nation Building in the American Century (University of Massachusetts Press, 2012); and The Myth of the Addicted Army: Vietnam and the Modern War on Drugs (University of Massachusetts, 2009).

Struggling through a difficult economic climate, he also faces the usual challenges of running a growing company &#x2014; meeting payroll, balancing cashflow, hiring and firing employees, and maintaining relationships with vendors and customers. Guiding him through these difficulties while providing strength and insight is the practice of Zen. Utilizing his training as a Zen practitioner, Lesser learns to apply specific teachings such as the eight-fold path directly to work and life. In chapters such as "Work: The Impossible Request," "Appreciating Uncertainty," and "Accomplishing More by Doing Less," ZBA: The Zen of Business Administration provides readers with intimate, helpful advice, while acknowledging the paradox of applying spiritual practice to the business world.</p><p>"I love this book.

One morning she pets a cow, and sets off a chain reaction that seems never-ending. The cow gets her friendschickens, pigs, dogs and peopleto chase Donna, who manages to stay just a few paces ahead of the unruly mob. When a policeman stops her pursuers, Donna thinks she is safe. But Donna makes a mistakeshe thanks the cop with a pat on the head. He and his friends also join the chase. Soon the entire county is chasing Donnamen, women, children, cats, moose, geese, buffaloes, horses, and on and on. Finally, Donna can run no more. She stops, thorws up her hands, and asks, "What do you want?" When the mob replies, Donna is very surprised but most willing to oblige their request. This is a clever cumulative poem, with a regular rhyming scheme that moves faster and faster as Donna becomes more frantic. Truesdell's frenetic watercolor illustrations of the fast-moving red-headed heroine are perfect companions to the poem's pace and breakneck hilarity. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 1 The limerick-like stanzas of this story in rhyme are well suited to its pace. The chase starts when Donna pats a cow on the head. Each time she thinks that she has escaped her followers, she pats her rescuer and the chase is on again. Finally, she stops to ask everyone why and discovers that they all want their heads patted, too. The cheerful watercolors catch the frenetic silliness and avoid any hint of menace. This lighthearted nonsense would be best read aloud, and the illustrations are large and clear enough for a group. Running after someone to get a head pat seems less likely than some of the other picture books of a cumulative chase, like McClintock's A Fly Went By (Random, 1958), in which the race is a panic caused by a sheep with a can stuck on its foot.

The others were Cesar Chavez, Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales, and Jose Angel Gutierrez.<br>Tijerina is, significantly, the only member of this historical group to have penned his memoirs, perhaps in an effort to explain the trials and frustrations that brought him and his Federal Land-Grant Alliance members to break the law: reclaiming part of a national forest reserve as part of their inheritance; invading and occupying a courthouse; inflicting a gunshot wound on a deputy sheriff in the process; and challenging New Mexico and national authorities at every opportunity. But the acts that placed him in most danger were also the ones that won the hearts and minds of many young Chicano activists.<br>What is clear from Lopez Tijerina's testimony is his sincerity, his years of research on the issues of land grants and civil rights, and his persistent spiritual and political leadership of the disenfranchised descendants of the original colonizers of New Mexico. All of the passion and commitment, as well as the flamboyant rhetoric of the 1960s, is preserved in this recollection of a life dedicated to a cause and transformed by continuous prosecution.<br>They Called Me "King Tiger": My Struggle for the Land and Our Rights is a historical document of the first order, clarifying the motives and actions of one of the Chicano Movement's now-forgotten martyrs - a man who sought justice for those who have been treated like foreigners on their own soil.</p><p>A onetime minister and traveling revivalist, Reies L�pez Tijerina becam involved in disputes over historical land grants and in 1963 founded militant Alianza Federal de las Mercedes (The Federal Land-Grant Alliance). In 1966, he and his followers briefly seized part of the Kit Carson National Forest. Subsequent incidents escalated into violence (including an armed raid by the Alianza in June 1967 on a New Mexico county courthouse), and Tijerina ultimately served prison time for state and federal offenses.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>The Pleasure of Your Company</h2><p>More than just a cookbook, a guide to entertaining at home also helps readers learn how to cook for company, from backyard barbecues to the more formal sit-down dinner, and includes menus, recipes, and game plans to make timing simple and efficient. Tour.</p><p>Molly O&#39;Neill is the food columnist for The New York Times Magazine.O'Neill, food columnist for The New York Times Sunday Magazine overplays a coy device in her third cookbook (after A Well-Seasoned Appetite). She offers 150 recipes arranged in 25 dinner-party menus; preceding each menu is a two- or three-page tale about any of five selected cosmopolitan hostesses and their caterer fretting about entertaining in a hectic, health-conscious world. Many recipes are of the cook-ahead variety?but with caveats. O'Neill advises that Vanilla Scented Sauteed Fruit, a dessert, can be prepared "up to one hour before guests arrive," and that it's preferable to bake Caramelized Onion Biscuits after friends have walked in the door. Several recipes, among them Stilton-Walnut Rice Balls and White Bean Croquettes Stuffed with Mozzarella and Tomato, call for deep-frying and then serving immediately?a sure challenge for an edgy hostess. The recipes run from the familiar (yogurt cheese as an appetizer dip base and Stewed Lamb Shanks with White Beans and Rosemary) to the more unusual (Indian-Spiced Cucumber-Squid Salad and Japanese Chicken Salad with Nori Rolls). Simplifying suggestions include buffet dinners or stylish casseroles (Southwestern Chicken Pie with Cheddar Spoonbread Crust). When sanity is really threatened, a reader can do what O'Neill's hostesses sometimes do: hire someone to serve and clean or just have the party, either partly or entirely, catered. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>12 Days of Christmas Cookbook 2017 Edition</h2><p>Wonderfully unique,&nbsp;<i>The Twelve Days of Christmas Cookbook:&nbsp;2017 Edition&nbsp;</i>will delight your taste buds and make your Christmas season even merrier!

Her time spent at Chequers during her husband&#39;s term as Prime Minister (1990-1997) gave her a unique opportunity to research and write this book.A new book by the wife of Britain's current prime minister allows Anglophiles the unique opportunity to vicariously peer into ornate parlors, stroll through rose gardens, and survey the art collection of Chequers, the splendid country estate where prime ministers have spent time relaxing when not conducting government business or entertaining foreign heads of state. In addition to providing readers with glimpses of fine antiques and magnificent interiors, Major provides history buffs with an expansive accounting of the house itself, detailing numerous events and experiences that add color to the overall story of its occupation by renowned political figures. Period and modern photographs add substantially to a commendable effort that invites readers to visit a thus-far private residence steeped in history. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>The Imperial War Museum Book of the Desert War</h2><p>As the last major campaign fought exclusively by British and Commonwealth forces, the Western Desert continues to exert a fascination. From Wavell&#39;s offensive against the Italians in 1940, through the battles with Rommel&#39;s Afrika Corps, to the British success at Alamein, the Desert War remains one of the most extraordinary chapters in the history of World War II. In this book, assembled with the co-operation of the staff of the Imperial War Museum, are unpublished extracts from memoirs, diaries, letters and taped interviews. They reflect the experience of the campaign, from the noise and smoke of battle and the vagaries of desert life to leave spent in Cairo and Alexandria, the development of the Long Range Desert Group and the SAS, Rommel and the Afrika Corps and the role of the Commonwealth forces. Published on the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Alamein, this book serves as a reminder of the human face of war.</p><p></p><h2>Giants of the Polo Grounds: The Glorious Times of Baseball&#39;s New York Giants</h2><p>Traces the history of the Giants baseball team and looks at their greatest players and games from their founding to the move to San Francisco in 1957</p><p></p><h2>The Nimrod Hunt</h2><p>The appearance of non-living biological constructs threatens all life in the galaxy, and only the human of Earth stand between the galaxy and total annihilation</p><p></p><h2>Im Westen Nichts Neues</h2><p>Slight signs of wear!</p><p></p><h2>A Not So Still Life: A Memoir</h2><p>The painter son of the great surrealist Max Ernst describes his childhood amid the European avant-garde art world on the eve of World War II and his escape and new life in America</p><p></p><h2>War For the Hell of It: A Fighter Pilot&#39;s View of Vietnam</h2><p><b>Fast Eddie Tells It Like It Was</b><br>What's it like to fight an unwinnable war in the air?

What do you do when the Bad Guys are shooting at you?&nbsp; In this Amazon bestseller, Lt/Col Ed "Fast Eddie" Cobleigh shares his experiences in a deeply personal account of a fighter pilot's life, one filled with moral ambiguities and military absurdities offset by the absolute thrills of flying a fighter plane. &nbsp;Using well-crafted prose to put you in the Phantom's cockpit, Cobleigh recounts the tragic loss of his wingman, life at his base in exotic Thailand, the need to trust his reflexes, eyesight, aggressiveness, and his survival instincts in the heat of combat.

Now, the former chef and partner at Chez Panisse and the genius behind Stars San Francisco tells the story of his lifelong love affair with food -- an affair that helped to spark an international culinary revolution. Raised in the United States, Australia, and Great Britain, two-time James Beard Award-winner Jeremiah Tower was a man without a country -- until he immersed himself in the borderless world of great cooking and set out to create the &#34;serious simplicity&#34; that would change our notions of fine dining. Stumbling almost by accident into Berkeley&#39;s then-unknown Chez Panisse in 1971, he dazzled the San Francisco Bay Area -- and then the rest of the country -- with his dedication to fresh, local ingredients prepared simply. Eager to fulfill his own dining vision, he embarked on his quest to build the ultimate high-style &#34;democratic&#34; brasserie, San Francisco&#39;s Stars, where blue-jeaned rockers mixed with tuxedoed operagoers and political figures from around the world. With the expansion of Tower&#39;s empire into Hong Kong, Singapore, and Seattle, he became one of the first and most glamorous of the eighties &#34;super chefs.&#34; In this sparkling and candid memoir of his life with food, Tower tells the story of his rise and fall and rise again -- all intimately tied to the state of the culinary arts. More than a brilliant chef, Tower is an engaging storyteller who shares with wit and honesty the real dish on cooking, chefs, celebrities, and what really goes on in the kitchen. He exults in the exotic romance language of menus; the philosophy of brown sauce; the inner workings of a super restaurant; the drugs and sex that fueled the revolution; and culinary tours of Brittany, Morocco, and other glamorous ports. You&#39;ll get glimpses of such kitchen greats as the legendary James Beard, Chez Panisse&#39;s Alice Waters, renowned critic Craig Claiborne, plus Elizabeth David, Richard Olney, Julia Child, Paul Bocuse, Jean Troisgros, Paul Prudhomme, and Wolfgang Puck -- not to mention luminaries like Rudolph Nureyev, Luciano Pavarotti, and Sophia Loren. Above all, Tower rhapsodizes about food -- the meals choreographed like great ballets, the menus scored like concertos. No other book reveals more about the seeds sown in the seventies, the excesses of the eighties, and the self-congratulations of the nineties. No other chef/restaurateur who was there at the very beginning is better positioned than Jeremiah Tower to tell the story of the American culinary revolution.</p><p>Years back the standard Jeremiah Tower press kit claimed the master's hand in the development of everything to do with food just this side of the invention of fire. California cuisine? Caf� dining? Franco-Asian fusion food? All Jeremiah. Well, that was PR, a subject Tower addresses in his memoir of his life in food and the food business, <i>California Dish: What I Saw (and Cooked) at the American Culinary Revolution</i>. This isn't to say that Tower doesn't make his own argument for all his contributions, setting the record straight where he thinks the record has slipped into mythology. His contribution to the rise of Chez Panisse, for example. This is a man with an apparent lifelong habit of journal keeping. He isn't waiting for his own demise for the story to unfold. Rather, Tower tells all--his version of all--in the here and now, letting the chips fall where they may. The pleasure may be vicarious, but it-s a pleasure none the less.<p> In 50 years the organizing principle of this memoir, that the rise of California cuisine and who gets credit for what actually matters, may hold no water. But <i>California Dish</i> will remain invaluable as a memoir of the time by one of its more outlandish characters, a man who spent a good deal of his youth on ocean liners and in upscale hotel dining rooms. He shares all this in the spirit of James Beard's <i>Delights and Prejudices</i>, which documented an earlier time and way with food. Tower will be accused of cattiness, no doubt. And he is. He'll be accused of self-promotion. And he does. But he also lays on the praise where he believes it is due. When he admires other chefs and their work, he says so. In a series of scenes he returns to James Beard the dignity of his sexuality, like throwing the switch from two to three dimensions. </p><p> The first-person point-of-view often reveals much more about the writer than the writer ever intended. It's the nature of the beast. Tower may have been aiming at an improved press kit version of his life. But what press kit was ever poignant? For all the names of the famous, for all the celebrity happenings, the constant world travel, the designer labels, Jeremiah Tower seems a lonely man by book's end, a glass of fine champagne his best friend. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><b>Jeremiah Tower</b> is one of the world's foremost authorities on food, wine, and travel. He began his culinary career as chef and co-owner of Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California. From 1984 to 1998 he ran several other successful restaurants in San Francisco (Stars, Stars Caf�, Speedo 690), Hong Kong (The Peak Caf�), Singapore (Stars), and Seattle (Stars). In 1996 the James Beard Foundation named Tower "Outstanding Chef in America," one of many awards and honors he has received over the years. He is the author of two previous books, <i>Jeremiah Tower's New American Classics,</i> winner of a James Beard Award for the best regional cookbook; and <i>Jeremiah Tower Cooks.</i> Most recently, he hosted the PBS series <i>America's Best Chefs.</i> He currently resides in New York City.</p><h2>Plants for a Future: Edible &amp; Useful Plants for a Healthier World</h2><p>The way we currently produce our food is damaging both to ourselves and our planet. There is therefore a need to create gardens, woodlands and farms which are in harmony with nature. Natural ecosystems are good models, but many of the plants they contain are not necessarily edible. What we need is to discover and grow a wide variety of easily grown perennial and self-seeding annuals which provide delicious and healthy food, or are useful in other ways. Describing plants such as these, both native to Britain and Europe and from temperate areas around the world, this book includes those suitable for: the ornamental garden, the edible lawn, shade, ponds, walls, hedges, agroforestry and conservation. In this thoroughly useful book, Ken Fern shares his experiments and successes in growing herbs, vegetables, flowers, shrubs and trees. Packed with information, personal anecdote and detailed appendices and indexes, this pioneering book takes gardening, conservation and ecology into a new dimension.</p><p>Ken Fern has always been a plant enthusiast. Over the years he has experimented with, and compiled information on, a huge number of useful, unusual plants. With an increasing concern for the state of agriculture and the health of our planet, Ken decided to downshift from his job as a bus driver for London Transport in the early 1990s and move to Cornwall to establish the pioneering charity, Plants For A Future. With the help of Kens vast experience and encyclopaedic knowledge, Plants For A Future have now been trialling over 2,000 unusual species which are edible or have other uses, with a further 7,000 compiled on their database.Ken Fern leads us through a garden of improbable delights - cold climate yams five feet long, edible fuschia fruits, trees laden with delicious berries all through the winter, leaves and flowers with the most subtle and astonishing flavours. It shows us how to use land more efficiently and sustainably than ever before, and it brings to our sadly limited cuisine a vast new range of remarkable foods, all around the year. It is, in short, the first shot in an impending horticultural revolution. The result of an insatiable curiosity and years of painstaking research, this book is comparable in stature only to the works of Evelyn and Culpeper.

He was sent to boarding school in England and went to Trinity College, Oxford in 1937. He was still at Oxford when the Second World War broke out and, with other members of the R.A.F Volunteer Reserve, was immediately called to duty. He blew Spitfires in the Battle of Britain before being shot down and horribly burned. He underwent several operations by the great plastic surgeon, Archibald McIndoe. After a slow and very painful recovery, Hilary begged to be allowed to return to flying.

She holds out the possibility of a secret that will bring Joe peace of mind. But before he can ask any questions, she slips away.<br><br>Driven now by rage (have the authorities withheld information?) and a hope almost as unbearable as his grief (if there is one survivor, are there others?), Joe sets out to find the mysterious woman. His search immediately leads him into the path of a powerful and shadowy organization hell-bent on stopping Rose before she can reveal what she knows about the crash.<br><br>Sole Survivor unfolds at a heart-stopping pace, as a desperate chase and a shattering emotional odyssey lead Joe to a truth that will force him to reassess everything he thought he knew about life and death -- a truth that, given the chance, will rock the world and redefine the destiny of humanity.</p><p>Joe Carpenter, the hero of Dean Koontz's newest novel, <i>Sole Survivor,</i> is a man nearly paralyzed by grief. One year earlier, his wife and two children had been among the 230 victims of a plane crash that left no survivors. So when Joe encounters a woman who claims to have been aboard that plane and survived the catastrophe, and then she almost immediately disappears, he is understandably riled up. In the course of trying to track this woman down, Joe finds himself entangled in a web of shadowy conspiracy and perilous secrets. <p> In this latest book, Koontz pumps up the volume and gives his readers what they've come to expect from him: an expert mix of cover ups, cults, bizarre suicides, and a shocking twist at the end that keeps <i>Sole Survivor</i> racing along from one improbable but undeniably thrilling event to the next.</p>Critical acclaim for SOLE SURVIVOR<br><br>"Masterfully styled serious entertainment.

His science-fantasy stories set on the huge, exotic world called Majipoor began with <i>Lord Valentine's Castle</i> (1980), which the <i>Encyclopedia of Science Fiction</i> calls "polished but rather languid." In <i>Lord Prestimion</i>, the hero Prestimion takes the throne as Coronal, coruler of Majipoor, a millennium before Lord Valentine's reign. His crowning follows the long, ruinous civil war to overthrow a usurping Coronal, a war now literally forgotten: Prestimion's sorcerers have imposed amnesia on the people of Majipoor in hope of preventing any further uprising. Such a memory wipe reeks of wrongness and seems to have caused the infectious plague of insanity. Meanwhile, one very bad man, who is a leading rebel and warmonger, recovers his memories and escapes to make new mischief. After various colorful, almost dream-like travelogues, the situation is saved--a little too easily?--by telepathic gadgetry. (The device in question and several crossover characters appear in the 1982 story-cycle <i>Majipoor Chronicles</i>.) Smoothly written but somewhat short on real suspense, even in the swashbuckling comic sequence when Prestimion's Regent fights and kills at least 21 would-be assassins during one morning's office paperwork. It's just another day in the life of a Majipoor civil servant. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i><p> Robert Silverberg's many novels include the bestselling Lord Valentine trilogy and the classics <i>Dying Inside</i> and <i>A Time of Changes.</i> He has won more Nebula awards than any other writer, several Hugos, and the prestigious <i>Prix Apollo.</i> his Majipoor Cycle, set on the grandest and greatest world in all science fiction, is considered one of the jewels in speculative fiction's crown. </p><p> Robert Silverberg is the author of more than one hundred science fiction and fantasy novels and over sixty anthologies, including the much acclaimed <i>Legends,</i> which contains original short stories set in their most popular universes by Stephen King, Robert Jordan, Ursula K.

From a unified field theory to quantum physics to the Big Bang to the theory of relativity -- even superstring and chaos theories -- he examines all of the theories regarding the beginning of the universe and life (of all kinds) in that universe.<br><br> K�ng seeks to reconcile theology with the latest scientific insights, holding that "a confrontational model for the relationship between science and theology is out of date, whether put forward by fundamentalist believers and theologians or by rationalistic scientists and philosophers." While accepting evolution as scientists generally describe it, he still maintains a role for God in founding the laws of nature by which life evolved and in facilitating the adventure of creation.<br><br> Exhibiting little patience for scientists who do not see beyond the limits of their discipline or for believers who try to tell experts how things must have been, K�ng challenges readers to think more deeply about the beginnings in order to facilitate a new beginning in dialogue and understanding.</p><p>"Many will find it fascinating to see how a distinguished theologian offers his personal contribution to the dialogue between science and theology, writing in a bold and challenging manner and making good use of his wide reading and personal encounters."<br> -- John Polkinghorne, Canon Theologian of Liverpool Cathedral <p> "The prolific and inquisitive Hans K�ng guides us through the conundrums of Big Bang cosmology, evolution, and brain science, showing how science raises questions it cannot answer.

In <em>The Gentle Subversive</em>, Mark Hamilton Lytle offers a compact biography of Carson, illuminating the road that led to this vastly influential book. <br> Lytle explores the evolution of Carson's ideas about nature, her love for the sea, her career as a biologist, and above all her emergence as a writer of extraordinary moral and ecological vision. We follow Carson from her childhood on a farm outside Pittsburgh, where she first developed her love of nature (and where, at age eleven, she published her first piece in a children's magazine), to her graduate work at Johns Hopkins and her career with the Fish and Wildlife Service. Lytle describes the genesis of her first book, <em>Under the Sea-Wind</em>, the incredible success of <em>The Sea Around Us</em> (a <em>New</em> <em>York Times</em> bestseller for over a year), and her determination to risk her fame in order to write her "poison book": <em>Silent Spring</em>. The author contends that despite Carson's demure, lady-like demeanor, she was subversive in her thinking and aggressive in her campaign against pesticides. Carson became the spokeswoman for a network of conservationists, scientists, women, and other concerned citizens who had come to fear the mounting dangers of the human assault on nature. What makes this story particularly compelling is that Carson took up this cause at the very moment when she herself faced a losing battle with cancer. <br> Succinct and engaging, <em>The Gentle Subversive</em> is a story of success, celebrity, controversy, and vindication. It will inspire anyone interested in protecting the natural world or in women's struggle to find a voice in society.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mark Hamilton Lytle</strong> is Professor of History and Environmental Studies at Bard College. He is the author of <em>America's Uncivil Wars: The Sixties Era from Elvis to the Fall of Richard Nixon</em> (OUP, 2006) and coauthor of <em>After the Fact: The Art of Historical Detection,</em> Fifth Edition (2005), and <em>Nation of</em> <em>Nations: A Narrative History of the American Republic,</em> Fifth Edition (2004).<br>Biologist Rachel Carson (1907-1964), an outspoken forerunner of the environmental movement and author of the National Book Award-winning The Sea Around Us (1951), is best known for her groundbreaking, highly controversial tome Silent Spring (1962), a scathing expos� of the effects of DDT and other pesticides. In this brief, fascinating ecological biography by historian and fellow environmentalist Lytle, Carson's life is separated into four chapters?Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter-each focusing on the genesis, gestation and publication of Carson's four books. Lytle takes care in balancing his account, devoting equal attention to Carson's family life (for decades, Carson took care of her ailing mother, sister and nieces) as well as the arduous path of her career. Although she ultimately achieved wide recognition both as a writer and an ecologist, clearing the way for landmark environmental policy change, Carson endured staggering setbacks, including years of overcoming gender prejudice in a male-dominated field, her costly familial burden and several battles with recurring breast cancer?a fight she would ultimately lose at age 56. Lytle's spirited, thoroughly documented re-telling sheds ample light on the implications of this remarkable scientist's commitment to "protect the living things she loved so dearly."

Although other premodern societies developed similar conceptions, in no other major civilization were such ideas so pervasive or powerful. In The Development and Decline of Chinese Cosmology, John Henderson traces the evolution of Chinese thought on cosmic order from the classical era to the nineteenth century. Unlike many standard studies of premodern cosmologies, this book analyzes the origins, development, and rejection of these models, not just their structure. Moreover, while historians often limit their studies of cosmic order to specialized fields like the history of science, Henderson examines how the cosmological ideas formulated in late classical times permeated various facets of Chinese life, from high philosophy to popular culture. In discussing these ideas, the author draws surprising parallels between the history of Chinese and classical Western cosmologies, identifying general patterns in the development of cosmological conceptions in several premodern civilizations. This volume thus appeals not only to students of Chinese intellectual history, but anyone interested in cultural anthropology, ancient and medieval philosophy, and the history of science and medicine as well. An understanding of the development and decline of Chinese cosmology illuminates broad areas of traditional Chinese culture and it provides a new perspective for viewing the history of Chinese thought in a larger comparative context. John B. Henderson earned his Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley. He is Professor in the Department of History at Louisiana State University. Professor Henderson&#39;s previously published works include Scripture, Canon, and Commentary: A Comparison of Confucian and Western Exegesis and Notions of Time in Chinese Historical Thinking.</p><p></p><h2>The Best Jokes For 8 Year Old Kids!: Over 250 really funny, hilarious Q &amp; A Jokes and Knock Knock Jokes for 8 year old kids!

Most know that Roosevelt served as New York police commissioner during the 1890s, warring on crime while sponsoring reforms that reflected his good-government convictions. Later Roosevelt became an accomplished diplomat. Yet it has escaped attention that TR&#x2019;s perspectives on domestic and foreign affairs fused under the legal concept of &#x201c;police power.&#x201d;<br><br>This gap in our understanding of Roosevelt&#x2019;s career deserves to be filled. Why? TR is strikingly relevant to our own age. His era shares many features with that of the twenty-first century, notably growing economic interdependence, failed states unable or unwilling to discharge their sovereign responsibilities, and terrorism from an international anarchist movement that felled Roosevelt&#x2019;s predecessor, William McKinley. Roosevelt exercised his concept of police power to manage the newly acquired Philippines and Cuba, to promote Panama&#x2019;s independence from Colombia, and to defuse international crises in Venezuela and Morocco. Since the end of the Cold War, and especially in the post&#x2013;9/11 era, American statesmen and academics have been grappling with the problem of how to buoy up world order. While not all of Roosevelt&#x2019;s philosophy is applicable to today&#x2019;s world, this book provides useful historical examples of international intervention and a powerful analytical tool for understanding how a great power should respond to world events.</p><p>Examines how TR&#39;s philosophy of international relations is applicable to today&#39;s worldJames R.

He&#x2019;d rather be a minstrel, playing his rebec and writing ballads. But he was born to be a knight, and knights, of course, have adventures.</p><p>So after his father forces his knighthood upon him, he wanders toward King Arthur&#x2019;s court, in the company of a misguided young Welsh lad named Culloch. There Dinadan meets Sir Kai and Sir Bedivere, and the three find themselves accompanying Culloch on the worst sort of quest. Along the way, Dinadan writes his own ballads, singing of honor, bravery, loyalty, and courtly love&#x2014;and becomes a player in the pathetic love story of Tristram and Iseult. He meets the Moorish knight Palomides, the clever but often exasperating Lady Brangienne, and an elvin musician named Sylvanus, along with an unusual collection of recreant knights and dimwitted defenders of chivalry. He learns that while minstrels sing of spectacular heroic deeds, honor is often found in simpler, quieter ways.</p></p><p>When Gerald Morris was in fifth grade he loved Greek and Norse mythology and before long was retelling the stories to his younger sister and then to neighborhood kids. He began carrying a notebook in which he kept some of the details related to the different stories. The joy he found in retelling those myths continued when he discovered other stories. According to Gerald Morris, &#x201c;I never lost my love of retelling the old stories. When I found Arthurian literature, years later, I knew at once that I wanted to retell those grand tales. So I pulled out my notebook . . . I retell the tales, peopling them with characters that I at least find easier to recognize, and let the magic of the Arthurian tradition go where it will.&#x201d; Gerald Morris lives in Wausau, Wisconsin, with his wife and their three children. In addition to writing he serves as a minister in a church.Grade 5-9-Morris's latest retelling of Arthurian legends introduces a reluctant knight who upholds the noble standards of Camelot in his own way. The likable and unassuming Dinadan, younger brother of the famous Sir Tristram, travels the land, encountering deceptive damsels and foolish knights. His compassion and common sense earn him the respect of many, and his keen wit satirizes the excesses of Arthurian heroism that he observes along the way. The tragic tale of Tristram and Iseult becomes a funny story "about two fools drinking from the wrong flask." Dinadan befriends a would-be knight named Culloch, but can't endure the useless parade of tasks his friend eagerly attempts to win a bride. The humor is accessible; readers don't need to know The Faery Queene to appreciate Dinadan's playful mockery of allegory (or, as he calls it, "saying things by pretending to say something else"). Along with the satire, though, Dinadan succeeds in righting some true wrongs, protecting a young woman he admires, and restoring a deposed king to his throne. Morris's skilled storytelling keeps the tale moving smoothly through various plot strands featuring many characters. The humor ranges from subtle irony to scenes of pure comedy, but never distracts from the engaging plot. Fans of the previous titles or Arthurian legend in general will thoroughly enjoy Sir Dinadan, but it stands on its own as a lighthearted introduction to the period.<br><i>Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beautiful Knitting: Techniques &amp; Patterns for Creating Elegant Designs</h2><p>Used.

He has lived, taught and worked in Edinburgh for the last seven years where he was a member of the high profile writing group that also included Hal Duncan and Alan Campbell.If, after beginning this sequel to The Quantum Thief (2011), you find yourself wondering what the heck is going on here, don&#x2019;t panic: Jean de Flambeur, the novel&#x2019;s centerpiece, is wondering the same thing. Sprung (in the first novel) from a virtual prison by Mieli, a powerful woman who offers Jean his freedom in exchange for a service, he must return to his thieving ways and steal something for the pellegrini, a sort of godlike entity. But, even now, Jean still doesn&#x2019;t know exactly why he was busted out of prison, or what, precisely, he&#x2019;s stolen. He does know that, until he can pay off his debt to Mieli, he won&#x2019;t be able to recover his lost memories. To repay his debt, he must safecrack a Schr�dinger box and release the god that might or might not be trapped inside. Fans of the author&#x2019;s popular debut novel, which mixed hard science with wild fantasy, will probably be lining up for this follow-up, which resolves some of the questions posed in The Quantum Thief but, on the other hand, asks several more, for which there are, as yet, no answers. --David Pitt</p><h2>Virtual Girl</h2><p>Arnold Dexter breaks the law when he creates Maggie, a robot companion who seems perfect in every way, but when Maggie is separated from her creator, she begins to become a sentient being.

The state-of-the-art, multi-million-dollar operating room wouldn&#x2019;t have been unusual if it had been in a large hospital in a major city anywhere in the world. But this OR was smack in the middle of the jungles of Central Africa. <p></p>"Obviously I was brought all this way for a reason," Beth was saying a little desperately. "Just tell me <i>why</i>. There&#x2019;s no need to threaten me with the scalpel." When she got nothing more than a blank stare, she dragged in a deep breath, held it, then let it out slowly. "Who&#x2019;s in charge? You?" she asked the guy with the blade. <p></p> <i>Yeah. I&#x2019;d like to see the asshole in charge, too,</i> Sam thought, watching them through the small holes he&#x2019;d pierced in the metal duct. This top-secret compound, deep in the Huren jungle, belonged to President Sipho Nkemidilm. What was so damn urgent that he&#x2019;d had a prominent physician kidnapped from a bustling metropolitan hotel and flown thousands of miles to his hidden compound? <p></p>Something big. The compound was crawling with heavily armed, camo-clad soldiers. More of them than had been reported here a week ago. It didn&#x2019;t bother Sam that there were twenty trained soldiers in residence. Twenty to one weren&#x2019;t insurmountable odds. He had an arsenal of weapons on him, and a heavier pack, fully equipped, concealed several clicks away in the jungle. Another smaller pack was hidden just outside the compound. He was loaded for bear, with the skills and determination to use either his weapons, or whatever else was at hand. Whatever it took to expedite this rescue mission. <p></p>One of the men shoved a handful of blue fabric at Beth&#x2019;s midsection. It drifted to the floor as she made no move to accept it, and instead, glanced around the brightly lit room without moving her head. "Does <i>anyone</i> here speak English?" she asked with admirable calm. <p></p>They didn&#x2019;t. Or pretended they didn&#x2019;t. <p></p>Her red-gold hair, pulled up in its customary simple ponytail, was disheveled, and her amber freckles stood out in sharp relief on her pale skin. Her eyes flickered between the man holding her at blade-point and the threestony-faced,AK-47-wielding soldiers flanking her. <p></p>Two more uniforms were stationed at the door. A seventh man, presumably the anesthesiologist, stood hunch-shouldered and mute at the head of the operating table, clearly trying to make himself as unobtrusive as possible. <p></p>Wasn&#x2019;t going to save his sorry ass. Sam was ready, willing, and freaking able to blow the place to smithereens at the first opportunity. Once he had Beth. Once she was safe. Dropping down now, guns blazing, while personally satisfying, might get her killed. That was a risk he wasn&#x2019;t willing to take. <p></p>The son of a bitch with the scalpel at her throat would be the first to die. <p></p>They&#x2019;d snatched the wrong doctor. <i>His</i> doctor, goddamn it. At least that&#x2019;s what Sam believed. Beth was a general practitioner, and while he, and the entire town of Brandon, Montana, thought she was extra special, as far as he knew she didn&#x2019;t have any more skills than the several hundred other GPs in attendance at the symposium she&#x2019;d been attending in Cape Town. He suspected the tangos thought they&#x2019;d snatched plastic surgeon Lynne Randall. And the second they realized their mistake, Beth would be dead. <p></p>And before they killed her she&#x2019;d be begging to be dead <i>faster</i>. <p></p>He had to get her the hell out of here <i>sooner</i> than ASAP. People said Sam Pelton didn&#x2019;t have a nerve in his body, that ice water ran in his veins. But right now he was as scared as he&#x2019;d ever been. Everything was different about this op because Beth was in the center of it. <p></p>Scalpel-dick jerked his head, indicating that one of the men pick up what Sam presumed were scrubs. The pulse at the base of Beth&#x2019;s throat pounded her stress level, yet she still refused to accept the clothing. Her sangfroid was remarkable. But that was Beth. Always cool, calm and collected. <p></p> <i>That&#x2019;s it. Keep your head, sweetheart. I&#x2019;m right here. <p></p></i>Ignore the scalpel indenting her skin, Sam told himself savagely. Ignore the way her fear, and the stark white lights, leeched all the color from her face. Ignore the smudges under her eyes. Ignore the rapid pulse hammering in the hollow of her damp throat. <p></p>Ignore, God damn it, the fucking scalpel pressed to her carotid. <p></p>To do his job, he had to block Beth from his mind. Since he hadn&#x2019;t been able to do that for the past two years, it wasn&#x2019;t easy. He managed to do it anyway. <p></p>She swallowed hard, and the scalpel left a razor-thin line of blood on her neck. Right where Sam had been craving to kiss her for months. And that was the <i>last</i> fucking time he&#x2019;d resist the impulse to kiss her. As soon as he had her out of here, and it was safe enough to do so, he was going to kiss Beth like she&#x2019;d never been kissed before. To hell with restraint. To hell with waiting. <p></p>Instead of freaking out, she reached up and gently tried to push the man&#x2019;s hand away from her throat. With the slight shift in angle, the thin blade cut a red line between her thumb and forefinger. She cried out, making a big production so all the soldiers could see the blood. <p></p>Christ. Had she done that on purpose? <p></p>There was much frantic debate in Hureni as they tried to figure out what to do. Her injury clearly scared the crap out of them. They&#x2019;d wanted to scare her, they had no problem cutting her in small increments, but the injury to her hand had them in a panic. Beth had called their bluff. <p></p>She curled her fingers tightly into her palm, then cradled her bleeding hand against her chest. Blood stained her skin, shocking and redder than any blood Sam could remember. Maybe because Beth&#x2019;s skin was so pale. Hell. Maybe because this was Beth. <i>His</i> Beth. <p></p>Using every bit of control and all of his training, he clenched his teeth until his jaw ached. He might not be killing any of them, but he was counting the minutes and choreographing every move. <p></p>"I&#x2019;m not resisting," she said, her voice, to someone who had studied her for months, slightly uneven. "I&#x2019;m not fighting. There&#x2019;s no need to hurt me again. Call whoever&#x2019;s in charge and we ca&#x2014;" <p></p>Her words were cut off with a choked scream as the man grabbed her hair, using her sassy ponytail as a handle, yanking her head back, leaving her arched throat naked and vulnerable. <p></p>Light glinted off the blade as he yelled his displeasure, his angry spit splattering her face. <p></p>Sam&#x2019;s heart did a double tap as the scalpel carved another thin red line on the smooth skin, this time her cheek. <i>Three goddamn strikes and you&#x2019;re out, dick. Cool it</i>, he told himself, almost jumping out of his skin with the need to act. <p></p> <i>Now</i>. <p></p>But his training told him that while the guy was cutting Beth, the cuts were small and not life-threatening. Not to Beth. To the guy making them, it was a death sentence. The son of a bitch wasn&#x2019;t going to kill her, Sam rationalized, sweat beading his brow. The grunt with the scalpel wasn&#x2019;t high enough up the food chain for one thing, and for another, someone had brought a doctor here for a specific purpose. Hopefully he&#x2019;d find out the who and why before Scalpel-dick got any more aggressive with that blade and he was forced to kill him sooner rather than later. <p></p>Intel had reported that Nkemidilm wasn&#x2019;t in residence. He was off with his troops fighting the Mallaruzi on Huren&#x2019;s western border. Huren was also in the middle of a bloody, and extremely violent, civil war. The body count was sky high. Nkemidilm was a megalomaniacal sadist and was fighting with damn well everyone in <i>and</i> out of his country. He&#x2019;d trained in Russia, his army carried American-made weapons, and he had absolutely no regard for human life. His allies were no better. <p></p>The cold air blasting around Sam did nothing to cool his temper nor did it dispel the fear churning in his gut as he watched the tableau beneath his hiding place. <p></p>Nervous perspiration made Beth&#x2019;s creamy skin look dewy, touchable. They&#x2019;d let her remove the jacket to her black pantsuit, and her long-sleeved pink blouse was half untucked, sticking to her skin and smeared with dirt and blood. Even mussed she was sexy. She should be back home in Montana in her small clinic, dispensing suckers to damp-eyed kids and wearing the all-encompassing white coat of her profession. And giving him a hard time. <p></p>He&#x2019;d tried talking her out of attending the medical symposium in Cape Town when they&#x2019;d "accidentally" bumped into each other at the bank two weeks ago. South Africa was a country in flux. Not safe for tourists just yet, and counted as one of the most dangerous places in the world. Yet in spite of, or because of his warnings, she&#x2019;d gone anyway. <p></p>Who&#x2019;d taken Beth, and what the hell did they want with her? No. Not <i>Beth</i>. Dr. Lynne Randall. All Dr. Randall, safely sequestered in a local safe-house, could tell them was that Beth had gone upstairs to pick up some notes for her. Beth had been snatched moments after entering Randall&#x2019;s room. <p></p>Thank God his people in the Cape had been smart enough to squash the story from the press. None of the bad guys knew they&#x2019;d kidnapped the wrong woman. <p></p>"If no one in charge is coming, then I&#x2019;m&#x2014;" <p></p>One of the soldiers answered in Hureni. Sam didn&#x2019;t speak the language, and clearly neither did Beth. <p></p>Just her eyes moved as she addressed the anesthetist standing across the room. "Do <i>you</i> speak English?" <p></p>He gave her a blank stare and her attention returned to the man with the blade at her throat, who was still yelling at her. "I have no idea what you&#x2019;re saying," she told him crisply, raising her voice just enough to get his attention. Her hand must have hurt like hell, but she wasn&#x2019;t paying it any attention. <p></p>Scalpel-dick yelled louder, inches from her face. Louder didn&#x2019;t mean she could comprehend him any better. <p></p>The door opened and he shut up like a tap being turned off. The rest of the soldiers in the room snapped to, straight-backed, weapons at the ready-attention. Sam already had the Sig aimed at the potential new danger. <p></p>His heart skittered. <p></p> <i>Shit</i>. <p></p> <i>The Butcher</i>. Tau Thadiwe. <p></p>The terrorist was currently on every country&#x2019;s Capture Dead or Alive list. Six feet seven inches of solid muscle, with skin the color of dusty ebony, and currently dressed, unselfconsciously, in a short white hospital gown. Flip-flops snapping on his enormous feet, he strode into the room surrounded by a phalanx of soldiers. <p></p>If anyone was worse than Nkemidilm it was his old friend Thadiwe. The two men shared an alliance that went back to their covert training days in Russia some thirty years ago. The counterterrorist group Sam worked for was aware that Thadiwe was responsible for doing a little extracurricular work after his and Nkemidilm&#x2019;s basic training ended. Torture was both Thadiwe&#x2019;s specialty and his passion, and he&#x2019;d educated Huren&#x2019;s leader in the fine art of persuasion until both men were feared and revered for their sadistic skills. <p></p>The man was an amoral psychopath. Not only was he chillingly good at what he did, he relished his work. <p></p>Speculation had been rife about his whereabouts for months. And here he was. Deep in the jungle where no one would think to look. Thadiwe and Nkemidilm had done a damn good job keeping their friendship off the radar. They hadn&#x2019;t been seen together since 1996. <p></p>"Dr. Randall, thank you for coming," Thadiwe said in unaccented English. Sam didn&#x2019;t know if he felt better or worse getting the confirmation that they&#x2019;d snatched the wrong doctor. <p></p>Thadiwe approached Beth but didn&#x2019;t extend his hand, nor did he instruct his men to stand down. Suddenly he noticed her still bleeding hand. Hard to fucking miss since the left side of her pink blouse was stained red. The tango scowled. <p></p>"I wasn&#x2019;t aware that I had a choice," Beth said dryly. "Please tell this man to put the scalpel down. I&#x2019;m no threat." <p></p>Thadiwe turned on the man beside her who still had the scalpel at her throat. <p></p> <i>Move, Beth. For fuck&#x2019;s sake, move out of the way</i>. Without a word Thadiwe pulled the HK out of the holster of the soldier next to him and shot his man point-blank in the face. Beth flinched, jumping back as blood and brain matter spattered the area. She moved directly into Sam&#x2019;s line of fire. <p></p>For several stunned seconds nobody moved, then, his eyes on Beth, Thadiwe snapped his beefy fingers. One of his men rushed to hand him a handkerchief, which he used to wipe the blood off his face. The white gown he wore now had red polka dots all down the front. <p></p>Sam now knew who, and he had a pretty good idea why. He prepared to fire. <i>Move, Elizabeth! <p></p></i>"My apologies for the manner in which you were transported here, Doctor." Thadiwe wiped his hands, then tossed the bloodied cloth aside. "My men tend to be zealous in their interpretation of my instructions." <p></p>Beth&#x2019;s shoulders were stiff, and she was barely breathing. It was almost better not being able to see her face. Sam wanted to curve his hand reassuringly around her vulnerable nape. <p></p>"What is it you expect of me, Mister&#x2014;?" <p></p>"Tau Thadiwe," he said, signing her death warrant. Whatever surgery he wanted Beth to perform on him, he had no intention of letting her live afterward. "Prepare yourself to do facial reconstruction immediately, Dr. Randall." <p></p>Excerpted from Rescue Me by Shirley Green. <p></p>Copyright � by Shirley Green. <p></p>Published in 2008 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press <p></p>All rights reserved.

By his early twenties, Duke&#39;s lightning-fast swimming won him a place on the 1912 United States Olympic team and a gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle race. Over the years Duke struggled with racism and financial troubles, but by the end of his twenty-year Olympic career, he was a six-time medal winner. Although a swimming champion,Duke&#39;s passion was surfing. He traveled the world, introducing surfboarding to Australia and the east and west coasts of the United States. Considered the father of modern surfing, Duke spread his love of the ocean and Hawaii wherever he went. Throughout his life Duke Kahanamoku was beloved for his modesty, sportsmanship and amazing skill in the water. Today he remains a legendary waterman and an inspiration to all to live life with aloha.Surfer of the Century brings to life the determination, courage in adversity, and good sportsmanship of Duke Kahanamoku, one of the great surfers in history.(Nat Young, Four-time World Champion Surfer) An inspirational book about a great man.

A church musician, author, and composer, he was the organist, choirmaster, and composer at Her Majesty&#x2019;s Chapel Royal from 2000 to 2013. He is the author of <i>Christmas Carols: From Village Green to Church Choir</i>."The whole time I was reading <i>O Sing Unto the Lord</i>, I was making copious notes to go and rediscover some forgotten anthem. Time after time, passing references to pieces I&#x2019;ve sung and loved brought me sharp pangs of nostalgia, followed by a sense of gratitude that this tradition has been such an important part of my musical world." (<i>Nico Muhly, New York Times</i>)<br><br>"Gant&#x2019;s approach to church history via music works. With hindsight, it becomes easy to see how developments in monastic plainsong gave way to the spark of the Reformation, or to imagine how adding flourishes to cathedral choirs led to further exploration in religious art. The beauty of relating Christian history this way is that it broadens the focus to include the listening laity, not just the clergy or the church establishment." (<i>Foreword Reviews</i>)<br><br>"What, fundamentally, is the function of church music, and why have clerical authorities often been suspicious of how much attention music receives? Gant engages these questions in intelligent, energetic prose....Because he focuses on representative composers and works, Gant&#x2019;s work feels more intimate than broad. It&#x2019;s a book about people and the songs that many of us don&#x2019;t even know that we know." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The book&#x2019;s 400 pages should not deter readers: this is one of the wittiest and most whimsically irreverent works of scholarship in recent memory. . . . Sitting down with this book feels less like reading a monograph than like encountering a friendly fellow in a pub. . . . Gant&#x2019;s lively history will help keep the tradition alive.&#x201d; (<i>Christian Century</i>)</p><h2>Sexus</h2><p>First volume in the Rosy Crucifixion Series, originally published not by the Olympia Press, but rather Editions du Chene, Girodias&#39; prior imprint (he was forced out after financial difficulties). Sexus is among Miller&#39;s most diverting works, at times erudite, dull, erotic and tame, chronicling the author&#39;s first wife, his final days in New York, his crushing failures, and his many women.</p><p>Henry Miller was born in 1891 in Brooklyn, New York but he soon moved to Paris. His first book &#39;Tropic of Cancer was published in 1934. It was followed five years later by its sister volume &#39;Tropic of Capricorn&#39;. In 1940, Miller returned to the US where he wrote the &#39;Rosy Crucifixion&#39; trilogy which received great praise from the likes of Eliot, Pound and Beckett. Outside of France, however it was universally banned due to its sexually explicit and candid nature and was not published until 1963. Miller died in 1980.</p><h2>The collapse of British power</h2><p>The first book in the acclaimed Pride &amp; Fall sequence on British power in the 20th century This book explains the decay of British power bewtween 1918 and 1940 and its final collapse between 1940 and 1945. Some have sought to expalin this ineptitude, particularly between the two world wars, by citing the tremendous costs of the First World War in both treasure and manpower. Not so, says Corelli Barnett, who ruthlessly identifies the root causes which reduced Britain eventually to a satellite of the USA. Ranging over 100 years, drawing together arguments from many spheres - education and industry, diplomatic and imperial history, Cabinet papers and the Press - it is as fascinating to read as it is significant.</p><p><i><b>Correlli Barnett</b></i> is a world-renowned historian with particular prowess in military, naval, economic and social subjects.

Since the 1970s Helen and Newton Harrison have been creating art inspired by the earth. They established a worldwide network among biologists, ecologists, architects, urban planners, politicians, and other artists to initiate collaborative dialogues about ideas and solutions which support biodiversity and community development. This definitive survey traces an influential joint career that has lasted nearly half a century. Organized chronologically, it features works from each decade, from their earliest installations to their continent-traversing work of the 1990s; and their most recent works both educating people about global warming and designing large scale responses to the phenomena itself.</p><p>Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison, known jointly as &#x201c;The Harrisons,&#x201d; are both distinguished professors retired from the University of California, San Diego. They are currently research professors at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><h2>The Science Delusion</h2><p>The science delusion is the belief that science already understands the nature of reality. The fundamental questions are answered, leaving only the details to be filled in. In this book, Dr Rupert Sheldrake, one of the world's most innovative scientists, shows that science is being constricted by assumptions that have hardened into dogmas. The sciences would be better off without them: freer, more interesting, and more fun.<p>According to the dogmas of science, all reality is material or physical. The world is a machine, made up of dead matter. Nature is purposeless. Consciousness is nothing but the physical activity of the brain. Free will is an illusion. God exists only as an idea in human minds, imprisoned within our skulls.</p><p>But should science be a belief-system, or a method of enquiry? Sheldrake shows that the materialist ideology is moribund; under its sway, increasingly expensive research is reaping diminishing returns.</p><p>In the skeptical spirit of true science, Sheldrake turns the ten fundamental dogmas of materialism into exciting questions, and shows how all of them open up startling new possibilities.</p><p><i>The Science Delusion</i> will radically change your view of what is possible. and give you new hope for the world.</p></p><p>Dr Rupert Sheldrake is a biologist and author of more than 80 technical papers and 10 books, including A New Science of Life. He was a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, where he was Director of Studies in cell biology, and was also a Research Fellow of the Royal Society.

It should be on every science student's course.' * <i>The Oldie * 'This is a delightful, interesting, informative, highly readable and much needed book and we definitely recommend it.' * Greenspirit.org.uk * 'A fascinating, humane and refreshing book that any layman can enjoy, in which he takes ten supposed scientific 'laws' and turns them, instead, into questions... Dr Sheldrake wants to bring energy and excitement back into science... he has already done more than any other scientist alive to broaden the appeal of the discipline, and readers should get their teeth into the important and astounding book.' * <i>Country Life * 'We must somehow find different, more realistic ways of understanding human beings - and indeed other animals - as the active wholes that they are, rather than pretending to see them as meaningless consignments of chemicals. Rupert Sheldrake, who has long called for this development, spells out this need forcibly in his new book. He shows how materialism has gradually hardened into a kind of anti-Christian principle, claiming authority to dictate theories and to veto inquiries on topics that don't suit it, such as unorthodox medicine, let along religion. He shows just how unworkable the assumptions behind today's fashionable habits have become. The 'science delusion' of his title is the current popular confidence in certain fixed assumptions - the exaltation of today's science, not as the busy, constantly changing workshop that it actually is but as a final, infallible oracle preaching a crude kind of materialism... His insistence on the need to attend to possible wider ways of thinking is surely right.' * Mary Midgley, <i>The Guardian * 'Isn't it nice to have some mystery back? Isn't it nice to have doubts?' * <i>Esquire * Rupert Sheldrake shows very convincingly the way that time and again scientists refuse to look at anything outside a very limited set of possibilities. Sheldrake shows powerfully how some professional skeptics simply have no interest in looking into claims for anything outside of our current scientific understanding. A valuable and powerful message. * www.popularscience.co.uk * 'Rupert Sheldrake does science, humanity and the world at large a considerable favour.' * Colin Tudge, <i>The Independent * 'Certainly we need to accept the limitations of much current dogma and keep our minds open as we reasonably can. Sheldrake may help us do so through this well-written, challenging and always interesting book.' * Crispin Tickell, <i>Financial Times * 'There is something rather odd about the current state of science. For Rupert Sheldrake, [it is] facing a 'credibility crunch' on many fronts. He presents this challenging argument by identifying 'ten core beliefs that most scientists take for granted.' He then interrogates each in turn by reformulating it, in the spirit of radical scepticism, as a question. This Socratic method of inquiry proves surprisingly illuminating. A serious mind-expanding book.' * James le Fanu, <i>The Spectator * 'The author, a biologist, takes issue with the idea that science already understands the nature of reality - and in doing so, frees up the spirit of enquiry.' * <i>The Times * 'This is a terrific, engrossing book that throws open the shutters to reveal our world to be so much more intriguing and profound than could ever have been supposed.' * Dr James Le Fanu, author of <i>The Rise and Fall of Modern Medicine * 'Sheldrake powerfully reminds us that science must be pursued with an open mind.' * Robert Jackson, former UK Minister for Science *</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></p><h2>Child of My Heart</h2><p><p>In Alice McDermott's first work of fiction since her best-selling, National Book Award-winning<i> Charming Billy</i>, a woman recalls her fifteenth summer with the wry and bittersweet wisdom of hindsight.</p><p>The beautiful child of older parents, raised on the eastern end of Long Island, Theresa is her town's most sought-after babysitter--cheerful, poised, an effortless storyteller, a wonder with children and animals. Among her charges this fateful summer is Daisy, her younger cousin, who has come to spend a few quiet weeks in this bucolic place. While Theresa copes with the challenge presented by the neighborhood's waiflike children, the tumultuous households of her employers, the attentions of an aging painter, and Daisy's fragility of body and spirit, her precocious, tongue-in-check sense of order is tested as she makes the perilous crossing into adulthood. In her deeply etched rendering of all that happened that seemingly idyllic season, McDermott once again peers into the depths of everyday life with inimitable insight and grace.</p></p><p>Fifteen is a year of clarity; you're still one of the kids, but you're finally beginning to unlock the mysteries of adult behavior. In her luminous novel <i>Child of My Heart</i>, Alice McDermott's narrator is a 15-year-old girl who has two qualities that give her access to the secret lives of adults: she's beautiful, and she looks after their children. Her beauty has already shaped her life. Her parents have moved the family to the east end of Long Island in hopes of finding her a wealthy husband, or at least a fancy crowd to run with. Here she babysits the children of the rich, whose fathers demonstrate their relative decency by making passes at her, or not. The novel spans a dreamy summer as our heroine spends her days with her various charges at the beach, happily leading her crew on home-grown, rather sweet adventures. Among the kids she looks after is a toddler whose father is a famous, aging artist. The narrator's preternatural acuity is apparent in this exchange with a new client: "Mrs. Richardson learned by direct inquiry that I lived in that sweet cottage with the dahlias (interested) and went to the academy (more interested) and babysat for this child of the famous artist (most interested) down the road." <i>Child of My Heart</i> is a pretty straightforward coming-of-age novel, but it's marked throughout by this beautifully honed, wry, knowing tone. McDermott's narrator reminds us that our lost innocence might not have been so innocent after all. <i>--Claire Dederer</i><p><b>Alice McDermott</b> is the author of four previous novels: <i>Charming Billy</i>, winner of the National Book Award in 1998; <i>At Weddings and Wakes; That Night; </i>and <i>A Bigamist's </i><br><i>Daughter.</i> She lives with her family outside Washington, D.C.</p></p><h2>Sing a Song to Jenny Next</h2><p>I&#39;ve read thousands of books over the years, many of which are military history and biography, but few have left such a powerful, lasting impression on me as this book. It&#39;s a well written first hand account of a U.S. Marine who was virtually forced, as well as deceived, into becoming part of what was intended by its American training officers to be a suicide commando group tasked with destroying a Chinese atomic bomb facility during the Korean War. The story is so incredible that it almost beggars belief, particularly their betrayal by their training officers. This is definitely a &#34;must read&#34; book, as well as a &#34;must have&#34; book.

Remember, death and life are in the power of the tongue.</p><p>&#x2014;Joel Osteen</p><p>Phil&#x2019;s name sounded vaguely familiar. A quick Internet search confirmed the connection: Our paths had crossed about twenty years earlier at a client organization. His interview for my company&#x2019;s general manager position ended up more like a college reunion. We reminisced about mutual friends in the business, swapped client names, and bemoaned travel mishaps.</p><p>&#x201c;So why do you want to go to work for me?&#x201d; I ask him. &#x201c;Your LinkedIn page says you&#x2019;re vice president of marketing for some company.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s only part-time right now. The new company I&#x2019;m with is just a little ahead of the market. I need something else to bridge that gap before they can afford to hire me full-time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me about the new business, then.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes light up like a Christmas tree, and he launches into an explanation about the new venture. He&#x2019;s working for a Hollywood movie producer, who has a few sideline businesses of play-on-demand movies in hotel chains. They produce 3-D programming sold to networks such as ESPN, Hallmark, and Disney.</p><p>&#x201c;Got any reality TV shows in mind?&#x201d; he asks offhandedly as he ends his tale.</p><p>&#x201c;As a matter of fact, I do.&#x201d; I toss out a concept that had occurred to me while writing my last book.</p><p>&#x201c;Hmmm. That could work. Seriously. I&#x2019;ll pass the idea on to Barry if you want me to. He&#x2019;s in LA this week. Have you been to Universal Studios? Amazing place. Anyway. Barry makes all those show decisions. I don&#x2019;t get into that. I just sell the programming into the hotels once the shows are shot. Occasionally, I go on one of the funding meetings&#x2014;if they&#x2019;re close by. Like a couple of weeks ago. Barry got a few doctors in a room. Pitched them on a new series he&#x2019;s doing. Twenty-five minutes. They all invested $50,000, and that was enough to put the first series in the can. . . . But it&#x2019;s unusual for me to go.&#x201d;</p><p>We talk a little further about the general manager&#x2019;s job. But I quickly decide it&#x2019;s a no-go. He&#x2019;s a nice guy, but I need a long-termer in the position.</p><p>A week later Phil calls again. &#x201c;Barry will be back from LA tomorrow afternoon. I mentioned your reality TV show to him. He wants to talk to you. Can you meet with him tomorrow at two?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Actually, I hadn&#x2019;t given the idea another minute&#x2019;s thought since Phil had left my office a week earlier. But I spend the rest of the day and evening writing up a treatment.</p><p>The next day Barry, Phil, and I meet in my office. We trade background information. Barry tells me about the movies he and his business partner have produced&#x2014;a long string of titles that I recognize immediately. Then he overviews several reality TV shows they are currently shooting.</p><p>At this point, I decide to show him the two-page concept that I&#x2019;d drafted.</p><p>He skims it, then looks up. &#x201c;I like it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you would be expecting me to <i>invest</i> in this show?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. That&#x2019;s <i>my</i> job&#x2014;to raise the funding. We would own the show together and split the net profits fifty-fifty.&#x201d;</p><p>My first thought: Maybe he&#x2019;s taking money out of the proceeds, so that there <i>is</i> no profit. &#x201c;Could you forward a typical production budget for my review?&#x201d; His assistant does so the next day.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, we meet several times to discuss the specifics of the deal. On one occasion, he brings his son with him, who is working on a documentary for the History Channel.</p><p>Barry agrees to add every clause and safeguard I propose into our written contract. He reports that a couple of networks have already expressed interest in my concept, and he has an investor for our first $60,000.</p><p>&#x201c;So when are we going to start shooting the pilot?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&#x201c;As soon as I finish up the series I&#x2019;m on&#x2014;end of December.&#x201d;</p><p>December comes and goes. &#x201c;So are you ready to schedule the pilot? I need to line up the talent. They travel frequently, so I need to nail down dates with them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have to have at least $50- to $60,000 to shoot the sizzle reel and pilot.&#x201d; He explains where he thinks he can cut $10,000 out of the budget by using a simpler set and a local crew.</p><p>Budget-conscious. I like that.</p><p>Joe, Barry&#x2019;s show runner, calls me from Hollywood to begin discussing details: run time, music, on-camera talent, potential product placements, website, and so forth.</p><p>&#x201c;So don&#x2019;t we have funding already committed&#x2014;at least for the pilot?&#x201d; I ask the next time Barry stops by the office. &#x201c;I thought you said an investor had already committed $60,000?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He backed out.&#x201d; Long pause, then, &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m still committed to the idea. We&#x2019;ll get it done. We just need $50- to $60,000 to get started.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, no need to be disappointed. We&#x2019;re busy now anyway. I&#x2019;m shooting two other projects. There&#x2019;s no hurry with me. Unless you&#x2019;re in a hurry?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that Joe has already asked me to schedule the talent, and the three contestants can be available to record this month&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t know about later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then, look, my company will put up half of the $50,000 if you will put up the other half,&#x201d; Barry offers.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I didn&#x2019;t plan to invest any money in this myself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand. That&#x2019;s completely your choice. We&#x2019;ll just keep working on getting investors as we&#x2019;d planned, then. And if you know of friends or colleagues who might like to invest, let me know. Whatever you&#x2019;re comfortable with.&#x201d;</p><p>I do more checking on Barry. One of his companies appears to have a contract with a pro sports team. The other company&#x2019;s website is announcing the new forthcoming 3-D series programming, featuring a legendary sports figure as its star. Two more series are listed as &#x201c;forthcoming.&#x201d;</p><p>I write out the $25,000 check and phone him. He promises to stop by and pick it up on his next visit by the end of the week.</p><p>Joe in LA becomes the point man. I get a text message at nine a.m. &#x201c;Late night. Will call you later today.&#x201d; No call. Next day an email would come in at eight p.m. &#x201c;Sorry. Got held up in a long script meeting. Will call Thursday.&#x201d; On Thursday: &#x201c;Have the flu. Think I&#x2019;m going to rest over the weekend. Let&#x2019;s talk on Monday.&#x201d; On Monday: &#x201c;No point in talking without the producer, and his current job is running over a couple of days. I&#x2019;ll try to set up a conference call after he&#x2019;s finished with this client.&#x201d; Next, Joe has a bad auto accident.</p><p>You know the end of this story: Barry disappeared. Phil protested innocence, and then stopped returning calls&#x2014;from me or my attorney. Joe&#x2019;s two-line &#x201c;obituary&#x201d; appeared in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> a few weeks later.</p><p>By nature, I&#x2019;m a skeptical soul. So why begin this book by telling this tale of getting scammed? My point: Building trust and persuading people to do something can be quite easy if you know what you&#x2019;re doing.</p><p>That&#x2019;s both good and bad. It&#x2019;s good if you have a person or group&#x2019;s best interest at heart. It&#x2019;s bad if you have selfish or sinister motives in mind.</p><p>Good communicators influence people in subtle ways. They find common ground, build rapport over a long period of time, and strive to appear trustworthy. They never act like the stereotypical aggressive con artist you see in the sitcoms.</p><p>(For an analysis of all the steps Barry and Phil took to win my trust&#x2014;and the trust of many others, as I later discovered from articles on the Internet about prior convictions and prison time&#x2014;see the next chapter on trust.)</p><p>The more popular word of the past few years has been <i>influence</i>. But whatever term you prefer, communication is essentially about making things happen, getting action, changing behavior, or changing minds. Changing someone&#x2019;s mind from negative to neutral about you, a cause, or an issue may be the biggest shift of all.</p><p>In short, communicating, especially at work, is purposeful. Sure, you also communicate to inform or educate&#x2014;but usually the result of that informative message or education is to influence someone to <i>do</i> something or <i>change</i> something.</p><p>The same is true in your personal life&#x2014;but with an additional purpose. At home, you communicate to change relationships&#x2014;strengthen them, deepen them, move them off dead center, test them, improve them, enrich them, or end them.</p><p>Yet people communicate every day to make things happen or to get a point across. They say they want to:</p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>sell</i> an idea&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>increase</i> their impact&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>recruit</i> top talent to come to work for their organization&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>educate</i> consumers about the advantages of their products&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>sway</i> members to support their position&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>urge</i> employees to cooperate with the new policy&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>inspire</i> others to peak performance&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>encourage</i> people to donate generously&#x201d;<br><p>However they phrase it, their goal is to persuade or influence. In fact, some people hesitate to use the word <i>persuade </i>because it has taken on an almost pejorative meaning&#x2014;the motif of manipulator from the movies. <i>Persuading</i> is not a dirty word. It&#x2019;s not about manipulation. It&#x2019;s a neutral word. Whether it&#x2019;s good or bad depends on intellectual honesty, choice, purpose, and outcome.</p><p><b>Intellectual honesty:</b> Is it misleading or deceptive?</p><p><b>Choice:</b> Do people have real choices about complying?</p><p><b>Purpose:</b> Is it harmful? In whose best interest is it?</p><p><b>Outcome:</b> What is the effect of the choice, decision, or change?</p><p>Most people equate communicating persuasively with <i>talking</i> someone into doing something. But <i>talking</i> is just a small step in the process&#x2014;or may not be a part of the process at all.</p><p>Persuading is primarily about<i> thinking. </i>Talking is <i>one way</i> to communicate some of your thinking or <i>one way</i> to find how other people think, so that you know how to approach them to change their thinking.</p><br><b> The Big Challenge</b><br><p>Are most people eager to be persuaded, moved to action, or changed?</p><p>Empirical evidence says no. The vast majority of people (88 percent) report that they break their New Year&#x2019;s resolution before the end of January.1 And New Year&#x2019;s resolutions are usually changes people decide they want to make themselves! So, clearly, whether they&#x2019;re talking about getting physically fit, financially fit, or mentally fit, people do not find change easy.</p><p>People openly resist being persuaded. They record their favorite TV programs in order to fast-forward through commercials. When the sales associate in the store says, &#x201c;May I help you?&#x201d; they automatically say, &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m just looking&#x201d;&#x2014;even if two minutes later they ask for help to find something.</p><p>My point&#x2014;and the challenge: People have become overburdened with information, are skeptical of spin, and are wary of those trying to persuade them to do anything.</p><p>At the same time, more and more people are trying to break through with a message. We want to influence others to do something. Those who earn a living in sales remain a steady and significant part of the workforce&#x2014;manufacturers reps, Realtors, social media marketers, pharmaceutical sales reps, financial advisors, and consultants.</p><p>And of course if you&#x2019;re in a service business (entrepreneurs, IT consultants, attorneys, accountants, dentists, freelance writers), you&#x2019;ve always depended on selling skills to make a success of the venture. Influencing others to hire, sign a contract, or make a decision on the next project proves crucial to your success.</p><p>Good communication may not make a risky project sound safe, but poor communication may fail to convey the benefits of a good project or good deal.</p><br><b> We&#x2019;re All in the Fishbowl</b><br><p>Another reason for your communication to be intentionally persuasive is this: You will succeed or fail in a very public way. It seems as though everybody has become a publisher! Even my eighty-nine-year-old mom is on Facebook. The masses have gained access to the Internet. After all, what else can you do with people on the other side of the globe that&#x2019;s fun, free, and fast except blast out your thoughts on everything from world peace to weight loss? Posts on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, and blogs have become as much a daily habit as eating. Smartphones seem to be an extension of the human hand. Text messages can be received instantaneously around the world.</p><p>The self-publishing phenomenon blasts out even more persuasive messages: e-books, white papers, reports, webinars, videos on YouTube and Vimeo. Everywhere you turn, people are screaming at you to pay attention to their ideas: Do this, don&#x2019;t do that, buy this, attend that, believe that, adopt this strategy, discover the secret to X. They either love your ideas&#x2014;or hate them. They either affirm you and your approaches or debunk them&#x2014;loudly and publicly.</p><p>So, from CEO to entry-level employee, from soccer parent to retired golfer, we all live in a fishbowl now. A hallway conversation can be captured on someone&#x2019;s cell phone, posted online, and go viral in a matter of seconds, and as a result, careers and earnings take a nosedive. CEOs can&#x2019;t hide in the corner office with an assistant to shelter them from the world. Teachers no longer rule their classroom when students can flip out their cell phones and push the Record button. Employees can no longer claim innocence when a colleague whistle-blower can tweet evidence.</p><p>Once words leave your mouth, credibility goes either up or down. Trust remains stable, grows, or plunges.</p><p>All the raw ingredients of communication (words, body language, emotion, logic, action, inaction, listening, branding, perception, structure, and so forth) produce change&#x2014;either positive or negative.</p><br><b> The Nine Core Principles of Persuasive Communication</b><br><p>This bookpresents nine core principles of persuasive communication. As we move through each chapter, you&#x2019;ll see what causes communication to fail and what makes communication succeed in changing behavior or changing minds:</p><p>The Law of Trust vs. Distrust</p><p>The Law of Collaboration vs. Monologue</p><p>The Law of Simplicity vs. Complexity</p><p>The Law of Tact vs. Insensitivity</p><p>The Law of Potential vs. Achievement</p><p>The Law of Distinction vs. Dilution</p><p>The Law of Specificity vs. Generalization</p><p>The Law of Emotion vs. Logic</p><p>The Law of Perspective vs. Distortion</p><p>I&#x2019;ll examine each of these core principles and explain how to apply them practically so that you can use them immediately to get your point across, bring about change, inspire others to take action, encourage your family member or team, or sell a product or service more successfully.</p><p>That&#x2019;s our mission in the following pages.</p><p>&#x2014;Dianna Booher</p></p><h2>The Secret Adversary.

Agatha Christie is the best-selling author of all time. She wrote eighty crime novels and story collections, fourteen plays, and several other books. Her books have sold roughly four billion copies and have been translated into 45 languages. She is the creator of the two most enduring figures in crime literature-Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple-and author of The Mousetrap, the longest-running play in the history of modern theatre. Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born in Torquay, Devon, England, U.K., as the youngest of three. The Millers had two other children: Margaret Frary Miller (1879&#x2013;1950), called Madge, who was eleven years Agatha's senior, and Louis Montant Miller (1880&#x2013;1929), called Monty, ten years older than Agatha. During the First World War, she worked at a hospital as a nurse; later working at a hospital pharmacy, a job that influenced her work, as many of the murders in her books are carried out with poison. On Christmas Eve 1914 Agatha married Archibald Christie, an aviator in the Royal Flying Corps. The couple had one daughter, Rosalind Hicks. They divorced in 1928, two years after Christie discovered her husband was having an affair. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, came out in 1920. During this marriage, Agatha published six novels, a collection of short stories, and a number of short stories in magazines.</p><h2>Ceramic Art of the Italian Renaissance</h2><p>Published 1987 The Trustees of the British Museum</p><p></p><h2>The Great Dying/Cosmic Catastrophe Dinosaurs and the Theory of Evolution</h2><p>Proposes that a catastrophic collision between Earth and an enormous cosmic body, followed by months of darkness, soaring temperatures, poisoned air, and a dead ocean, caused the extinction of the dinosaurs sixty-five-million years ago</p><p>Debate has raged for almost a decade on the theory that the impact of an extraterrestrial object caused extinction of the dinosaurs. In this very personal account Hsu, a geologist whose books include The Mediterranean Was a Desert, reviews the diverse threads that led him to support the bolide theory. Sedimentation rates, carbon and oxygen isotopes, iridium anomalies, magnetic reversals, marine-terrestrial correlations, and planktonic turnover are all deciphered, and a comet is found to be responsible. Hsu goes on to criticize the theory of Natural Selection, linking it to political-sociological philosophies and events at the turn of the century, and advocating instead a theory of chance and catastrophe drawn from the philosophy of China. His arguments on this topic are unconvincing. Nevertheless, informed readers and specialists alike will find much of interest in this book. Walter P.

Yes, indeed it was. Tell our grandchildren.<br><br>The Donheads<br><br>He was spectacularly clean. You might say ostentatiously clean. His ancient fingernails were rimmed with purest white. The few still-gold hairs below his knuckles looked always freshly shampooed, as did his curly still-bronze hair. His shoes shone like conkers. His clothes were always freshly pressed. He had the elegance of the 1920s, for his garments, whatever they looked like off, always became him. Always a Victorian silk handkerchief in the breast pocket. Always yellow cotton or silk socks from Harrods; and some still-perfect from his old days in the East. His skin was clear and, in a poor light, young.<br><br>His colleagues at the Bar called him Filth, but not out of irony. It was because he was considered to be the source of the old joke, Failed In London Try Hong Kong. It was said that he had fled the London Bar, very young, very poor, on a sudden whim just after the War, and had done magnificently well in Hong Kong from the start. Being a modest man, they said, he had called himself a parvenu, a fraud, a carefree spirit.<br><br>Filth in fact was no great maker of jokes, was not at all modest about his work and seldom, except in great extremity, went in for whims. He was loved, however, admired, laughed at kindly and still much discussed many years after retirement.<br><br>Now, nearing eighty, he lived alone in Dorset. His wife Betty was dead but he often prattled on to her around the house. Astonishingly in one so old, his curly hair was not yet grey. His eyes and mind alert, he was a delightful man. He had always been thought so. A man whose distinguished life had run steadily and happily. There was no smell of old age about his house. He was rich and took for granted that it (and he) would be kept clean, fed and laundered by servants as it had always been. He knew how to treat servants and they stayed for years.<br><br>Betty had been successful with servants, too. Both she and Old Filth had been born in what Americans called the Orient and the British Raj had called the Far East. They knew who they were, but they were unselfconscious and popular.<br><br>After Betty's death the self-mockery dwindled in Old Filth. His life exploded. He became more ponderous. He began, at first slowly, to flick open shutters on the past that he had, as a sensible man with sensible and learned friends (he was a QC and had been a Judge), kept clamped down.<br><br>His success as an advocate in Hong Kong had been phenomenal for he had had ease, grasp, diligence and flair. His career had taken off the minute he had begun to be briefed by the Straits-Chinese. It was not just that scraps of eastern languages began to re-emerge from his childhood in Malaya, but a feeling of nearness to the Oriental mind. When Old Filth spoke Malay or (less ably) Mandarin, you heard an unsuspected voice. Chinese, Malay and Bengali lawyers &#x2014; though often trained at Oxford and the Inns of Court &#x2014; were thought to be not straightforward but Filth, now Old Filth and after his retirement often Dear Old Filth, had found them perfectly straightforward, and to his taste.<br><br>All his life he kept a regard for Chinese values: the courtesy, the sudden thrust, the holiness of hospitality, the pleasure in money, the decorum, the importance of food, the discretion, the cleverness. He had married a Scotswoman but she had been born in Peking. She was dumpy and tweedy with broad Lanarkshire shoulders and square hands, but she spoke Mandarin perfectly and was much more at home with Chinese ways and idiom than she ever felt on her very rare visits to Scotland. Her passion for jewellery was Chinese and her strong Scottish fingers rattled the trays of jade in the street markets of Kowloon, stirring the stones like pebbles on a beach. 'When you do that,' Old Filth would say &#x2014; when they were young and he was still aware of her all the time &#x2014; 'your eyes are almond-shaped.' 'Poor Old Betty,' he would say to her ghost across in another armchair in the house in Dorset to which they had retired and in which she had died.<br><br>And why ever Dorset? Nobody knew. Some family tradition somewhere perhaps. Filth said it was because he disliked everywhere else in England, Betty because she felt the cold in Scotland. They both had a dismissive attitude towards Wales.<br><br>But if any old pair had been born to become retired ex-pats in Hong Kong, members of the Cricket Club, the Jockey Club, stalwarts of the English Lending Library, props of St Andrew's Church and St John's Cathedral, they were Filth and Betty. People who would always be able to keep servants (Filth was very rich), who would live in a house on The Peak, be forever welcoming hosts to every friend of a friend's friend visiting the Colony. When you thought of Betty, you saw her at her round rosewood dining table, looking quickly about her to see if plates were empty, tinkling her little bell to summon the snakey smiling girls in their household livery of identical cheongsams. Old Filth and Betty were perfectly international people, beloved ornaments at every one of the Memorial Services to old friends, English or Chinese, in the Cathedral. In the last years these deaths had been falling thick and fast upon them.<br><br>Was it perhaps 'The Pound' that drew them to Dorset? The thought of having to survive one day in Hong Kong on a pension? But the part of Dorset they had chosen was far from cheap. Betty was known to 'have her own money' and Filth had always said merrily that he had put off making Judge for as long as possible so that he hadn't to live on a salary.<br><br>And they had no children. No responsibilities. No one to come back to England for.<br><br>Or was it &#x2014; the most likely thing &#x2014; the end of Empire? The drawing-near of 1997? Was it the unbearableness of the thought of the arrival of the barbarians? The now unknown, but certainly changed, Mainland-Chinese whose grandparents had fed the baby Miss Betty on soft, cloudy jellies and told her frightening fairy tales?<br><br>Neither Filth nor Betty cared for the unknown and already, five years before they left, English was not being heard so much in Hong Kong shops and hotels and, when it was heard, it was being spoken less well. Many familiar English and Chinese had disappeared to London or Seattle or Toronto, and many children had vanished to foreign boarding schools. The finest of the big houses on The Peak were in darkness behind steel grilles, and at Betty's favourite jeweller the little girls behind the counter, who sat all day threading beads and who still seemed to look under sixteen although she had known them twenty years, glanced up more slowly now when she rang the bell on the armour-plated door. They kept their fixed smiles but somehow found fewer good stones for her. Chinese women she knew had not the same difficulty.<br><br>So suddenly Filth and Betty were gone, gone for ever from the sky-high curtains of glittering lights, unflickering gold, softgreen and rose, from the busy waters of the finest harbour in the world and the perpetual drama of every sort of boat: the junks and oil tankers and the private yachts like swans, and the comforting, bottle-green bulk of the little Star Ferries that chugged back and forth to Kowloon all day and most of the night. <i>This deck accommodates 319 passengers</i>. Filth had loved the certainty of the 19.<br><br>So they were gone, far from friends and over seventy, to a house deep in the Donheads on the Dorset-Wiltshire border, an old low stone house that could not be seen from its gate. A rough, narrow drive climbed up to it, curving towards it and out of sight. The house sat on a small plateau looking down over forests of every sort and colour of English tree, and far across the horizon was a long scalpel line of milky, chalky downland, dappled with shadows drawn across it by the clouds. No place in the world is less like Hong Kong or the Far East.<br><br>Yet it was not so remote that a doctor might start suggesting in a few years' time that it might be kinder to the Social Services if they were to move nearer to civilisation.

When Danny arrives at the school, the blood-spattered crime scene turns even his veteran stomach. What could this young woman have done to make her the target of such a violent attack? And what is the significance of the victim&#x2019;s left hand, taken by the killer as a grisly trophy? Beckett delves into the case with his usual tenacious cool, yet as he pieces together the facts, long-suppressed anguish from his own past rises up with stunning force. His hunt for the murderer soon morphs into a personal quest for atonement as he struggles to come to terms with the loss of his wife and family. A King of Infinite Space is a riveting crime novel that serves as a memorable introduction for Danny Beckett to the ranks of fiction&#x2019;s favorite hardened detectives.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Tyler Dilts on <em>A King of Infinite Space</em></strong> <br> <p>When I began writing <em>A King of Infinite Space</em>, I was in graduate school earning an MFA in fiction writing. As is the case in many such programs, there was a good deal of autobiographical introspection in the writing going on around me, and that was the last thing I wanted to do. I wanted to do something different. One of the main reasons I've always loved reading is that it takes me away from myself and allows me to experience the lives of other people. What, I asked myself, could I credibly write about that was very different from my own experience?</p> <p>My father was a Los Angeles deputy sheriff, and throughout most of my youth, I wanted to be a police officer. Although my career goals changed, I was left with a considerable amount of background knowledge that I felt I could put to good use. And it didn't hurt that my favorite writers included the likes of James Lee Burke and Michael Connelly. It was settled, I thought. I'll write a police procedural--I know enough about it (with a fair amount of research thrown in) to sound authoritative, and what could be further from an English grad student&#x2019;s personal experience than a story about investigating homicides?</p> <p> I did decide to allow myself one autobiographical detail. My father died when I was very young, and I decided to have Danny Beckett, the novel's protagonist, share this experience. It would, I thought, give the two of us a bit of common ground and help me relate to the character.</p> <p>As the writing and rewriting progressed, I felt a reassuring sense of distance from Danny, a sort of critical perspective that thought allowed me to shape and hone the character with a studied and intellectual reserve that seemed properly authorial and intellectual.</p> <p>So it came as quite a surprise when the novel was finished and my friends and family began to read it. Danny sounds just like you, they said. I refused to accept this, so I interrogated them. One by one they pointed out details and ideas and jokes and phrases that they'd heard from me, usually more than once. And a few of those closest to me commented on the similarity between Danny's and my voices and perspectives. Eventually, I had to admit they were right.</p> <p>But it was only recently, when I had occasion to look through an old family photo album and saw a picture of myself at age four, around the time of my father&#x2019;s death. I wore a clip-on tie, a makeshift shoulder holster complete with cap gun, and an expression befitting the most serious of detectives. It was me I was looking at, but I couldn&#x2019;t help thinking it might just as well have been Danny Beckett.<em></em></p>Tyler Dilts is a native of southern California and a graduate of the MFA program at California State University, Long Beach, where he now teaches.

Perspectives on the significance of the war and its aftermath varied considerably from different cultural vantage points. Northern and western Indians, European imperial authorities, and their colonial counterparts understood and experienced the war (known in the United States as the French and Indian War) in various ways. In many instances the progress of the conflict was charted by cultural differences and the implications participants drew from cultural encounters. <br><br>It is these cultural encounters, their meaning in the context of the Seven Years' War, and their impact on the war and its diplomatic settlement that are the subjects of this volume. <i>Cultures in Conflict: The Seven Years' War in North America</i> addresses the broad pattern of events that framed this conflict's causes, the intercultural dynamics of its conduct, and its profound impact on subsequent events? most notably the American Revolution and a protracted Anglo-Indian struggle for continental control. <br><br>Warren Hofstra has gathered the best of contemporary scholarship on the war and its social and cultural history. The authors examine the viewpoints of British and French imperial authorities, the issues motivating Indian nations in the Ohio Valley, the matter of why and how French colonists fought, the diplomatic and social world of Iroquois Indians, and the responses of British colonists to the conflict. The result of these efforts is a dynamic historical approach in which cultural context provides a rationale for the well-established military and political narrative of the Seven Years' War.<br><br>These synthetic and interpretive essays mark out new territory in our understanding of the Seven Years' War as we recognize its 250th anniversary.</p><p>Warren R. Hofstra is Stewart Bell Professor of American History at Shenandoah University. Of his numerous publications, he is the author of The Planting of New Virginia: Shenandoah Valley Landscapes, 1700&#x2013;1800 and the coeditor of George Washington and the Virginia Back Country.This book offers an up-to-date and relevant look at the war from a variety of viewpoints, including Canadians, Native tribes, Europeans, and American Colonist. In the process, these essays paint a vivid portrait of not only the causes and execution of war, but also its long term impact on American History, native cultures, the ongoing hostilities between native peoples and Anglo colonists. . . . A compelling book, and essential reading for anyone with an interest in any aspect of the war. (<i>History In Review</i>)<br><br>The essays in the volume stand as a testament to the editor and contributors. (<i>Virginia Magazine</i>)<br><br>Jonathan Dull's chapter on France in this era is perhaps the best overview of the French role in the war to be found. (<i>The Historian</i>)<br><br><i>Cultures in Conflict</i> is an exceptional collection of essays from a diverse group of scholars. Readers will find a historiographic overview and the most recent archival research on the Seven Years' War in North America. This book raises an intriguing set of questions about early America and offers refreshing new perspectives. Particular emphasis is placed on the pivotal role played by native communities, and on the way the conflict forced native peoples to create new political and economic identities to survive its devastation.

After helping put down the Boxer Rebellion in China, narrator Travers, who's never done an honest day's work and lives by virtue of his wits and good luck, is promoted to captain in what promises to be a meteoric rise through the military ranks. Because of his supposed expertise in dealing with insurgency, he's sent to the Philippines to help quell a rebellion aimed at ridding the islands of their American landlords. Immediately after he arrives in Manila, U.S. headquarters is attacked by guerrillas; forced against his will to lead a squad in pursuit, Travers recovers an ancient map, only to have it stolen-and then to discover that the map points to Spanish treasure. And so Travers volunteers to hunt down the rebel leader, but his real mission is to line his pockets with gold. Through generally workmanlike prose, Saunders captures the era, with its violence, imperialism and racism, and weaves a rollicking yarn that should attract new readers to "Fenny" and his bawdy escapades. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dead Duke, His Secret Wife, and the Missing Corpse: An Extraordinary Edwardian Case of Deception and Intrigue</h2><p><p><strong>One of the most notorious and bizarre mysteries of the Edwardian age, for readers who loved <em>The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher</em>.</strong></p><p>In 1898, an elderly widow, Anna Maria Druce, came to the British court with an astonishing request. She stood among the overflowing pews of St. Pauls Cathedral claiming that the merchant T. C. Druce, her late father-in-law, had in truth been a secret identity for none other than the deceased and enormously wealthy 5th Duke of Portland. Maintaining her composure amid growing agitation from the clutch of lawyers, journalists, and curious onlookers crowded into the church, Mrs. Druce claimed that Druce had been the duke's alter ego and that the duke had, in 1864, faked the death of his middle-class doppelg�nger when he grew tired of the ruse. Mrs. Druce wanted the tomb unlocked and her father-in-law's coffin exhumed, adamant that it would lie empty, proving the falsehood and leaving her son to inherit the vast Portland estate. From that fateful afternoon, the lurid details of the Druce-Portland case spilled forth, seizing the attention of the British public for over a decade.</p><p>As the Victoria era gave way to the Edwardian, the rise of sensationalist media blurred every fact into fiction, and family secrets and fluid identities pushed class anxieties to new heights. The 5th Duke of Portland had long been the victim of suspicion and scandalous rumors; an odd man with a fervent penchant for privacy, he lived his days in precisely coordinated isolation in the dilapidated Welbeck Abbey estate. He constructed elaborate underground passageways from one end of his home to the other and communicated with his household staff through letters. T.C. Druce was a similarly mysterious figure and had always remained startlingly evasive about his origins; on his arrival in London he claimed to have "sprung from the clouds."</p><p>Drawing from revelations hidden within the Druce family tomb in the chilly confines of Highgate Cemetery, Piu Marie Eatwell recounts one of the most drawn-out sagas of the era in penetrating, gripping detail. From each thwarted investigation and wicked attempt to conceal evidence to the parade of peculiar figures announcing themselves as the rightful heir, Eatwell paints a portentous portrait of England at the dawn of the Edwardian age.</p><p>Few tales&#x2015;be they by Charles Dickens or Wilkie Collins, <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> or <em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>&#x2015;could surpass the bizarre and deliciously dark twists and turns of the Druce-Portland affair. A mesmerizing tour through the tangled hierarchies of Edwardian England, <em>The Dead Duke, His Secret Wife, and the Missing Corpse</em> illuminates the lies, deceit, and hypocrisy practiced by "genteel" society at the time&#x2015;and their inevitably sordid consequences.</p> 30 illustrations</p><p>Piu Eatwell is the author of Black Dahlia, Red Rose and The Dead Duke, His Secret Wife, and the Missing Corpse and has produced and researched historical documentaries for the BBC and other channels, including the widely acclaimed film Charles Manson: The Man Who Killed the Sixties.

Kirk, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Colonel Kira Nerys, Captain Kathryn Janeway, and the crews confront untold perils in the distant reaches of space. Original.</p><p><i>What Lay Beyond</i> brings the Gateways saga to a spectacular finish, in all-star collaboration by six popular, bestselling Star Trek� authors. Among them, <b>Diane Carey, Peter David, Keith R.A. DeCandido, Cristie Golden, Robert Greenberger,</b> and <b>Susan Wright</b> have written dozens of Star Trek� novels. This is their first mega-collaboration.<p><b>Chapter One</b><br> </p><p> Captain Kirk was suspended in the gateway, floating between the countless dimensions. The interstellar transport lasted for only a few seconds, but the flashing light seemed to freeze every thought and feeling he had. </p><p> Then he was falling out the other side, rolling to his feet and unsteady on the soft surface. He was standing on the edge of a small platform, suspended near the top of a giant crevice. The sheer parallel cliffs extended for miles to either side. </p><p> Holding his arms out for balance, Kirk could only look down. The cliffs descended out of sight. The bottom was obscured by mist or smoke that was rising, softening the sharp edges of the cliffs. The rocks on both sides looked as if huge sections often sheared off and fell forever into the center of the planet. </p><p> Backing away from the edge, Kirk looked around and saw the two Kalandans. "Tasm! Stop!" </p><p> Commander Tasm was on the other side of the platform, trying to wrest away the large cylindrical unit from her errant officer, Luz. The blue neutronium cylinder was the key component of the gateway, and they were waving it around between them at the edge of an abyss! </p><p> Kirk briefly considered stunning them, but they were too close to the edge and he was afraid they would be knocked over by the impact. So he ran forward and grabbed Tasm around the waist, pulling her away. Luz hung on to the cylinder and came with her. </p><p> The soft ground gave Kirk plenty of traction, and he was able to drag both women closer to the wall of the cliff. There was an arched doorway there leading to a tunnel. Apparently that was the way off the platform. </p><p> Tasm struggled against him, but Kirk took hold of the cylinder with one hand, expertly twisting it away from her. The Kalandans were thin and frail even if they were tall. </p><p> But Luz hung on, kicking at him and jerking on the cylinder as if she were crazed. It swung wide and hit Tasm in the head, driving her down to the ground with an agonized cry. The commander rocked crouching on her knees, her head in her hands. </p><p> Glaring at him, Luz managed to push Kirk closer to the sheer drop. The streaks of green and blue on her eyelids suddenly looked right. He hadn't seen such a display of outright passion from any of the Kalandans. </p><p> "It's mine!" Luz screamed. "Let go!" </p><p> Kirk stayed calm. "Stop fighting me or we're both going over." </p><p> In response, she swiped a leg at him, catching him behind the knee. Kirk stumbled, and her momentum carried her forward, taking him right to the edge of the platform. Kirk wasn't letting go of the cylinder. He meant it -- if he went over, then he was taking her with him. </p><p> Their brief struggle showed that she didn't know anything about hand-to-hand combat. But she fought in a frenzy, nearly knocking him off the platform. </p><p> Kirk got his feet under him and spun away from her, back toward the doorway in the cliff. As she fell back, he grabbed hold of her wrist. She tried to wrench it away from him, but he twisted her arm down, forcing her to take one hand off the cylinder. </p><p> With a quick turn, he stepped behind her, bringing her arm behind her back. Now that he had leverage on her, he had the advantage. She didn't have enough brute power to shake him off. </p><p> He jerked the cylinder from her grasp and bent her arm up until she went to her knees. Her cry didn't stop him. He hung on to her long enough to make her realize there was no way she could win in a fight. "Had enough?" </p><p> Panting, she continued to struggle to get away from him. But she knew she couldn't beat him. </p><p> Finally Kirk let go, pushing her away to roll on the ground next to Tasm. Tasm was still on her knees, groaning from her head injury. Her eyes were bleary as she tried to focus on him. </p><p> Kirk pulled his phaser from his belt and trained it on them both so they didn't get any more ideas. Then he quickly assessed his situation. They were standing on a platform hardly six meters square. But what he had mistaken for soft sand was really some kind of plush rubbery material that coated the rock. </p><p> He took a few steps inside the tunnel, getting a better look at the thick beige stuff. It ran up the sides, covering it completely. Farther in, the tunnel ended. When he poked at the stuff, it felt like a dense block of suede. </p><p> Back outside, Kirk looked in both directions up and down the crevice. He had seen two metal-plated buildings on top of the cliffs before jumping through the gateway. Now he had to strain to see them. They were much farther up on the opposite side. The sun in the orange sky was so bright it made it hard to focus on the dull metal. </p><p> One look at the cliff behind him, and he knew it couldn't have been a tougher climbing challenge. Kirk was willing to bet he could make it with hands and feet alone, with the gateway cylinder strapped to his back by his uniform jacket. But that was his last resort. </p><p> Still holding the phaser on the two women, Kirk demanded, "Where are we?" </p><p> Tasm was moaning and clutching her head, so he jerked his phaser at Luz. "You brought us here. What is this place?" </p><p> Luz's lips drew back from her teeth, a desperate expression. "This is our birthing world." </p><p> "You aren't Kalandans." </p><p> "We're Petraw!" she spit at him. "You're such fools! Such trusting fools..." </p><p> Tasm was struggling to stand up. "Silence, Luz! You've betrayed your pod -- " </p><p> <i>"I</i> saved the interstellar transporter!" Luz let out a high-pitched shriek, rushing at Tasm. </p><p> With surprise on her side, Luz managed to shove Tasm toward the edge. Tasm fell flat to stop herself from going over. Luz sat on top of her, grabbing her around the throat, screaming inarticulately. </p><p> "You never learn, do you?" Kirk dropped the cylinder to go to Tasm's defense, but he wasn't exactly willing to risk his own life for her. Aiming his phaser, he hesitated as they rolled over, Tasm on top, then on the bottom again. </p><p> Before he could fire, he was surrounded by people. Hands grabbed his arms and took away his phaser. They were rough, their manner abrupt. It was like they appeared out of nowhere. </p><p> Kirk stopped struggling immediately. When they realized he was giving them no trouble, they let his arms free so he could stand among them. He couldn't see what had happened to his phaser, but it was gone. </p><p> They separated Tasm and Luz, taking them to opposite sides of the platform. Kirk counted eight humanoids crowded onto the platform, dressed alike in whitish-transparent bags complete with enclosed hands and feet. The loose hoods over their heads slid forward. </p><p> Kirk settled his uniform, reaching down for the cylinder. But one of the strange people picked it up first. </p><p> Kirk had to look up to see his face. It was like melted wax, with his nose, eyes, and chin softened and flattened. </p><p> "I'm James T. Kirk of the <i>Starship Enterprise.</i>" Kirk pointed to the cylinder, holding out his hand. "I believe that belongs to me." </p><p> Luz cried out, stumbling forward. Kirk couldn't understand what she was saying, something about completing an engagement... Tasm was speaking to others, still holding one hand to her injured head. Clearly these were her people. </p><p> The androgynous Petraw held up the cylinder. "This is for the matriarchs to deal with." </p><p> "Are those your superiors?" Kirk asked. Getting an affirmative in response, he agreed, "Lead the way." He was more than ready to talk to someone in charge. Tasm had clearly lied to him about everything. </p><p> Tasm and Luz were herded into the tunnel behind him. It had somehow become unclogged and continued much deeper inside the cliff. It curved ahead, so he could only see a short way, and the top was within reach of his hand. It was cramped, but better than climbing that towering cliff freehand. </p><p> Kirk could hardly see a thing. There was no obvious light source, but the pliable material covering the walls was so pale it seemed to glow like amber under a light. </p><p> It wasn't long before the tunnel ended in a slightly more bulbous section. Straight ahead were six hexagonal openings stacked three across and two high. Each opening was about a meter wide. </p><p> "In there." The Petraw holding the cylinder gestured to the first hexagonal opening on the bottom. </p><p> Kirk peered in, but he couldn't see out the other side. "This is the way to the matriarchs?" </p><p> Several of the Petraw crowded close to him, trying to push him inside. Their baggy coveralls rustled as he resisted. </p><p> "What's the rush?" Kirk tried to regain his footing on the mushy floor. </p><p> They still nudged him forward, pressing down on his shoulders. He realized he was being given no choice and he began to fight back. </p><p> Without hesitation, the Petraw seized his legs and arms, subduing him by sheer numbers. Before he knew it, they were tossing him into the hexagon. </p><p> They slapped something on the end. Kirk scrabbled at it with his fingers. The covering was hard and peach-colored, almost opaque. He could see the shadows of the Petraw outside, but even when he kicked hard against it with both feet, he couldn't budge the seal on the end. </p><p> After a while Kirk couldn't see any more shadows. It was pitch dark inside. He kept kicking against the plug, but it held firm. He crawled to the other end, checking it for openings, but it was sealed tight as well. He was trapped.<br> </p><p> It didn't take long to search the place. Kirk could sit up inside the cell if he hunched over, his hair brushing the ceiling. He could also lie down and stretch out to his full length, but both ends touched his feet and outstretched arms. It was a tiny, claustrophobic place. A sarcophagus buried in the rock. </p><p> He wasn't sure where the fresh air was coming from. Feeling around, he found nothing but smooth, slightly damp walls that were cool to the touch. Too bad his phaser was gone. But they hadn't taken his communicator. </p><p> Operating the communicator by touch, Kirk checked each frequency, listening for activity. There might be a Starfleet vessel in the area, or an allied planet that had diplomatic ties to the Federation. </p><p> "This is Captain James T. Kirk of the <i>Starship Enterprise.</i> Can anyone read me? I'm being held prisoner...." </p><p> He repeated his distress call on every frequency. If the Petraw didn't like it, they could come stop him. </p><p> But there was no response. The static was extremely high, crackling on the lower frequencies, leading him to believe that a shield could be interfering with the subspace channel. </p><p> Kirk grimly kept trying. </p><p> His voice was raw from speaking into the communicator when he finally gave up. No one could hear his calls. </p><p> A different course of action was required. Kirk flipped the cover up and felt the screen mesh. No sharp edges on it or on the smooth black body of the unit. He tried wrenching the cover from the communicator, straining with both hands to twist it out of its hinge. </p><p> The mesh cracked at one corner, breaking free and leaving a jagged edge. He winced when it cut his probing finger. The other corner slid out of the hinge. </p><p> Kirk dug the broken cover into the seal on the end of the cell. It reacted like some kind of polymer. The jagged edge left a small slice in the flexible stuff. </p><p> He hacked away at the seal. The polymer wouldn't tear, but successive jabs cut deeper into it. </p><p> Satisfied that he was finally making some progress, he worked faster. </p><p> </p><p> It took a while for Kirk to break through. At first only one hand could push out of the cell. He continued to dig at the polymer to enlarge the slash. </p><p> Getting his shoulders through was the hardest. He struggled with the polymer as if the cell were alive and determined to keep him inside. When he finally slid through, dragging his legs after him, he rolled onto the soft ground. </p><p> Only to find himself trapped again. The tunnel was exactly the same as before, nearly dark with no way to get out. But the Petraw were gone. </p><p> Kirk carefully retraced their steps, and found the tunnel once more clogged at the end with a dense mass of tan polymer. But now he knew that it could be opened. </p><p> He plunged his hands into the center, feeling them sink deeper and deeper. It was powdery dry. The stretchy texture reminded him of the thick rubber bands he had used as a kid for makeshift slingshots. He pushed harder on it. </p><p> The walls slowly started drawing back, opening up to reveal the platform where the gateway had deposited him. It was darker outside now, and Kirk went forward to see the blood orange sky looming over the parallel cliffs. It was densely spangled with bright white stars. Everything inside the crevice was ruddy, including the cliffs and the tunnel. </p><p> The Petraw could have taken a transport from the platform up to those metallic structures. But why did Luz bring them here instead of directly to the top? The last thing she had expected was for Kirk and Tasm to come along with her. </p><p> Kirk crouched down and went right to the edge of the platform to look over again. The crack seemed to descend forever, cleft deep into the planet. It was completely dark down there, and would likely be even in the brightest daylight. Plus there was that odd smoky mist. It didn't look very inviting. </p><p> No, the answer must lay inside the tunnel. </p><p> Kirk went back inside, returning to the six hexagon cells. </p><p> He didn't have much time before the tunnel began to close behind him, shutting out most of the light. But he searched the walls quickly, pushing and poking, trying to find another place where the polymer would open up. </p><p> Right next to the cells, his hands sank into the wall. Kirk leaned in, pushing his arms into the center. The barrier began to give way, irising into an opening tall enough for him to step through. It was not much brighter inside this tunnel, with the ambient light coming from a warm glow within the walls themselves. </p><p> The tunnel finally widened as it ended in a cross-tunnel.

This collection challenges that assumption by showing that dark shamans are, in many Amazonian cultures, quite different from shamanic healers and prophets. Assault sorcery, in particular, involves violence resulting in physical harm or even death. While highlighting the distinctiveness of such practices, <i>In Darkness and Secrecy</i> reveals them as no less relevant to the continuation of culture and society than curing and prophecy. The contributors suggest that the persistence of dark shamanism can be understood as a form of engagement with modernity.<p></p><p>These essays, by leading anthropologists of South American shamanism, consider assault sorcery as it is practiced in parts of Brazil, Guyana, Venezuela, and Peru. They analyze the social and political dynamics of witchcraft and sorcery and their relation to cosmology, mythology, ritual, and other forms of symbolic violence and aggression in each society studied. They also discuss the relations of witchcraft and sorcery to interethnic contact and the ways that shamanic power may be co-opted by the state. <i>In Darkness and Secrecy </i>includes reflections on the ethical and practical implications of ethnographic investigation of violent cultural practices.</p><p><i>Contributors.</i> Dominique Buchillet, Carlos Fausto, Michael Heckenberger, Elsje Lagrou, E.

Today's 20 year-old can put aside 71 a month and retire a millionaire. At 26, the magic number is a mere 130. At 35, sock away 324. Frances Leonard's easy Four-step program shows you how to use your youth and the miracle of compounding to put aside a few dollars now so that you won't have to worry about retirement for the rest of your life.Of course, putting aside any amount of money in your twenties and thirties is a drag. That's why the Four-Step program is designed to reward you well throughout your life. Start now, and you'll not only retire a millionaire&#x2014;you'll also have thousands of dollars over the years to spend on fun stuff while you're still young enough to enjoy it.Written specifically for the financial beginner, <i>Time is Money</i> provides the solid, straightforward information you need to radically change your future for the better&#x2014;without sacrificing every dollar today.</p><p><b>Frances Leonard,</b> the author of <i>Women and Money, </i> and <i>Money and The Mature Woman,</i> is a lawyer, lecturer, and writer on legal, financial, and economic issues.Leonard, author of Women &amp; Money, has written an upbeat financial-advice book for people in their 20s and 30s. Rather than attempting to account for every imaginable financial disaster, Leonard wisely focuses on one key issue?accumulating as much money for retirement as possible. Aided by very convincing statistics, she shows the importance of saving early: someone who invests $96 every month, starting at age 23, in an investment that earns an average of 10% annually, would accumulate a million dollars by the time he or she reaches age 67;on the other hand, if someone doesn't begin saving until he or she is age 42, that person would have to save $677 every month in order to have saved a million dollars at age 67. Leonard introduces an easy-to-understand four-step program to achieve this goal. These "steps to a fortune" include figuring out how much money you can set aside regularly; finding an investment that earns 10%-12% interest; using a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) plan; protecting your money against inflation and against the unexpected. Other chapters on the stock market, mutual funds, pension plans and other aspects of financial planning are also included. Probably most helpful to the many overspenders in the audience will be the section on managing debt and making the most of credit. Leonard's easy-going writing style with humorous quips should appeal to the intended readers. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Father Is a Book: A Memoir of Bernard Malamud</h2><p>On the twentieth anniversary of Bernard Malamud's death, Janna Malamud Smith explores her renowned father's life and literary legacy. Malamud was among the most brilliant novelists of his era, the author of the Pulitzer Prize winner The Fixer, as well as The Natural and The Assistant -- named one of the best "100 All-Time Novels" by Time. He counted among his friends Philip Roth, Saul Bellow, Theodore Roethke, and Shirley Jackson. Yet Malamud was also very private. Only his family has had full access to his personal papers, including revealing letters and journals that offer unique insight into the man and his work. In her candid, evocative, and loving memoir, his daughter brings Malamud to vivid life as no one else can.<br><br>Bernard Malamud, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, grew up in Brooklyn in a home overshadowed by poverty and mental illness. Unable to earn a living in New York, he took a teaching position in Oregon and moved his young family there. For Janna, it was an idyllic time and place. Her father was warm, funny, and passionate about his writing, which was gaining national attention. In 1961, an appointment to Bennington College brought the Malamuds back east and right into the middle of the heady, often hilarious free-for-all that was campus life in that radically changing time. But Bennington&#x2019;s anything-goes atmosphere and Malamud&#x2019;s growing fame came at a price to his family: his deep belief that one should live morally crashed into his premise that one should live fully.<br><br>Janna Malamud Smith speaks as only a daughter can of a fraught relationship with an adored father. In glowing praise of My Father Is a Book, Susan Cheever -- who also wrote memorably of her own father, John Cheever -- says, "This loving portrait of a writer's family from the inside describes good times and difficulties with affection and candor and provides a fascinating backstory for Malamud's great fiction."</p><p>JANNA MALAMUD SMITH is author of two New York Times Notable books, A Potent Spell and Private Matters, which was a Barnes and Noble &#x201c;Discover Great New Writers&#x201d; pick. She has written for the New York Times, the Boston Globe, and the Threepenny Review, among other publications. A practicing psychotherapist, she lives with her husband and two children in Massachusetts.Bernard Malamud was one of the most accomplished and appealing American novelists of the postwar years. From The Natural (1952) to The Assistant (1957) to The Magic Barrel (1958) to A New Life (1961) to Dubin's Lives (1979) -- to mention only five of the more than a dozen books he published -- he not only established himself in the first rank of American writers but also took the country's literature in new and important directions. Along with his contemporary Saul Bellow and the younger (by two decades) Philip Roth, he portrayed and interpreted the Jewish experience in America as something unique and discrete while at the same time he helped establish that experience as, ultimately, more American than Jewish.<p>As has been pointed out in this space on several occasions, all three of these men resisted being ghettoized as "Jewish-American writers," and with good reason, but there can be no getting around it: Their Jewish identity is essential to their fiction; indeed, it is impossible to imagine their fiction stripped of that identity. As is made plain by Janna Malamud Smith, Malamud's daughter, in this thoughtful, affecting memoir of her father, the sufferings of his forebears in the Russian pogroms of the early 20th century are the foundation upon which his life's work rests, as was his own difficult childhood in Brooklyn, with a loving but feckless father (the model, she says, for the Jewish grocer in The Assistant) and a schizophrenic mother who eventually lost all sanity and died when her son was a teenager.</p><p>For some time, it has been my impression that Malamud has faded away from the central place he once occupied in our literature. His name doesn't come up in discussions of important American writers as often as it did not so long ago. His publisher, Farrar Straus Giroux, faithfully keeps his books in print, and some of them -- notably The Natural and The Fixer -- still sell respectably, yet somehow he seems to have drifted out of the mainstream.</p><p>This, if my sense of it is correct, is a great pity. Not all of Malamud's work achieves the heights of The Assistant and The Magic Barrel, but it ranks with the best of his time, and far above what passes for the best of our own. Its most persistent themes -- the search for a new life and the struggle to achieve moral rectitude -- have lasting pertinence and have rarely been explored so subtly and perceptively in literature. His prose, at times melancholy and at others jaunty, achieves a near-perfect fusion of American and Jewish-American rhythms. He was as much fabulist as novelist, with the happy result that almost all of his fiction transcends time. It is true that things fell off toward the end of his life -- God's Grace (1982) and the posthumous The People and Uncollected Stories (1989) really should have been allowed to rest unpublished -- but his physical condition declined severely in the years before his death in 1986, and obviously his literary skills were affected.</p><p>Whether My Father Is a Book will do anything to reverse the slide in Malamud's fortunes cannot be predicted, but those of us who cherish his best work will be glad to have this intimate recollection of a very decent and very complicated man. The book is written with love and admiration -- Malamud seems to gave given his daughter no cause to do a daddy-dearest number on him -- but with a clear eye. Smith deals candidly with her father's tendency toward self-absorption, with his attendant habit of placing his work before everything else in his life, with his wandering eye and the love affair that weakened his marriage during the 1960s, with his imperfections as a parent. Like others who have written about famous parents, she cannot always resist the temptation to move herself into center stage when she may not really belong there, but on the whole she is self-effacing and good company.</p><p>The literature of fathers and daughters is scarcely so extensive as the literature of fathers and sons, and My Father Is a Book leaves no doubt that this is to be regretted. The relationship between Janna (born in Oregon in January 1952, when her father was 37 and her mother 34) and her father was mutually rewarding. They were "intensely attached, at ease with each other, deeply compatible" when she was a small girl, though -- predictably -- "we became touchy and awkward when, as I grew up, I sought to free myself. Father-female child we grasped; father-woman baffled each of us in different ways. We did not trust that I could go and stay. I think he feared that I would try to depart from him completely. I feared that he would somehow tether me." </p><p>Everything Malamud did involving his daughter was done out of love. He wanted Janna to be happy and usually -- though not constantly -- kept a watchful eye on her. He was, in his attitudes toward women, at once old-fashioned and welcoming. On the one hand, he believed that "women were less than men, labile, damaging," that "female aggression was not simply unpleasant; it was uniquely destructive." Understandably, his daughter was offended by this and has "spent a lifetime trying to make sense of his view." Yet on the other hand, he delighted in women -- he was "a ladies' man from grade school on -- eagerly dating, continually speaking with his buddies about girls" -- and not only as objects of amorous and sexual attraction. His correspondence with the Bennington student with whom he fell in love (to the detriment of his marriage) in the early 1960s reveals considerable respect for her intelligence, and he seems to have held Janna in similar regard.</p><p>She leaves no doubt, though, that as much as he loved her, her brother, and their mother, the center of his life was writing. He had begun writing seriously in the 1930s, when he was in his twenties and strongly under the influence of Sigmund Freud, and he seems to have recognized that this was his true vocation. His apprenticeship was arduous, ending in 1952 with the publication of The Natural:</p><p>"Although he may have been writing lightly when he told his wife, 'Now I join the sacred company,' my father was stating his deepest meaning. Whatever hunger for faith existed within him, he had transformed it into a belief in the sanctity of literature. Nothing mattered more to him than joining the company of recognized, serious writers. And in Manhattan, the buzz about The Natural -- the lunches with editors and salespeople, the photo session, the early reviews -- informed him that he had stepped across that threshold. Twenty years of lonely practice preceded the moment. His had been a long apprenticeship through many a night tunnel. Finally, he'd found the baseball story, a good choice both for a Jew intent on becoming an American and for a Brooklyn boy and Dodgers fan who'd never been physically graceful. . . . When a publisher bought the novel, when admired writers praised it, their acts elevated its creator from the farm league into the majors. He returned to Manhattan amazed to find he had been given a uniform, chosen to play on the team whose banners had long decorated his wall." </p><p>The Natural did not make him rich or famous, but it set him on the road to the recognition he craved. He was modest and self-effacing, playful and at times garrulous, but his literary ambition was fierce. He certainly didn't huff and puff, � la Hemingway or Mailer, but in his quiet way he wanted to be recognized as the literary artist he properly believed himself to be. Though the books that followed The Natural were all received enthusiastically and though he began to be the recipient of prestigious awards -- he eventually won two National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prize -- it wasn't until 1966, with publication of The Fixer, that he reached the bestseller lists and gained what passes for fame in the American literary world. </p><p>The Fixer remains his most famous book but is scarcely his best. That distinction belongs to The Assistant, not much longer than a novella, in which he explores all his most characteristic themes with extraordinary humor, compassion and tenderness. It is a masterpiece of postwar American fiction, albeit a miniature one, the story of a poor Jewish grocer in Brooklyn whose encounter with a young gentile -- the assistant of the title -- leads to a delicate, multi-layered exploration of suffering, redemption and other questions close to Malamud's heart. By contrast, The Fixer, though good-hearted and beautifully written, seems clumsy and obvious.</p><p>Janna Malamud Smith leaves no doubt that her father was as flawed as any of the characters whom he created. His remarkable self-discipline at his writing table often proved a barrier between him and the people who loved him, and his longing for the consolations of love led him into an extramarital adventure that left more pain than pleasure in its aftermath. Yet at heart he was a decent man, kind and solicitous by instinct, generous to other writers. Having had a hard, painful childhood, "he taxed himself hard to provide his children with what he had not had: stability, comfort, protection from the worst emotional horror." The extent to which he succeeded is revealed in his daughter's book, which is at once loving and lovely, a book worthy of the man.</p><p>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Cultural historian Elissa Mail�nder examines the daily work of twenty-eight women employed by the SS to oversee prisoners in the concentration and death camp Majdanek/Lublin in Poland. Many female SS overseers in Majdanek perpetrated violence and terrorized prisoners not only when ordered to do so but also on their own initiative. The social order of the concentration camp, combined with individual propensities, shaped a microcosm in which violence became endemic to workaday life. The author&#x2019;s analysis of Nazi records, court testimony, memoirs, and film interviews illuminates the guards&#x2019; social backgrounds, careers, and motives as well as their day-to-day behavior during free time and on the &#x201c;job,&#x201d; as they supervised prisoners on work detail and in the cell blocks, conducted roll calls, and &#x201c;selected&#x201d; girls and women for death in the gas chambers. Scrutinizing interactions and conflicts among female guards, relations with male colleagues and superiors, and internal hierarchies, Female <i>SS Guards and Workaday Violence</i> shows how work routines, pressure to &#x201c;resolve problems,&#x201d; material gratification, and Nazi propaganda stressing guards&#x2019; roles in &#x201c;creating a new order&#x201d; heightened female overseers&#x2019; identification with Nazi policies and radicalized their behavior.</p><p><b>Elissa Mail�nder</b> is Associate Professor at the Centre d&#x2019;histoire de Sciences Po and on the staff of the �cole des hautes �tudes en sciences sociales and the Centre interdisciplinaire d&#x2019;�tudes et de recherches sur l&#x2019;Allemagne in Paris.

As a young medical student he introduced the discoveries of Sigmund Freud to his professors. However, he saw that psychoanalysis neglected the exploration of what Maslow, some sixty years later, would call 'the farther reaches of human nature'. </p><p>Assagioli was ahead of his time and was not recognized until the late sixties when Psychosynthesis, his famous contribution to human understanding, was taken up by thousands of people around the world. </p><p>Psychosynthesis, a practical therapy designed to help people achieve their full potential, evolved out of fifty years of Roberto Assagioli's psychospiritual reflections. The gems of this rich collection are presented here in Transpersonal Development. </p><p>Part One describes the reality of the superconscious. Part Two delves into the problems and difficulties experienced on the spiritual path. Part three deals with the everyday application of those insights gained in the process of spiritual awakening. </p><p>The inspiring message of this book is that transpersonal development is not just for the exceptional few. It is possible for everybody. Assagioli gives practical guidelines to help people achieve the goal. He presents a vision of the integration of cultural, scientific, and human aspects which can give birth to a new humanity.</p></p><p>What a wonderful production! The new edition of Transpersonal Development is a great achievement. I had never liked the previous edition because the translation, for me anyway, made Assagioli's book seem rather uninteresting. Not so now! The new translation is fresh and brings the words alive in a new way, and there are real gems in here. Even though I've read it before in previous translations, it is like having a 'new' Assagioli book ... amazing! -- <i>Will Parfitt, Psychosynthesis writer and educator, personal recommendation</i></p><h2>Appalachian Wilderness: The Great Smoky Mountains</h2><p>The photography of Eliot Porter captures the majestic beauty of the Appalachian wilderness.

But after an over-zealous squeeze from visiting baby Norine, his new kitten, Mittens, sneaks off and disappears. Richard's father posts a notice in the morning paper: "Lost: black-and-gray tabby kitten. Child's pet. REWARD." The telephone begins to ring, and the doorbell repeatedly chimes, and an absurd array of pussycats is paraded by Richard's family. Not one of them is a gray and white tabby, and consequently, not one of them is Mittens. By day's end, Richard's hopes are dashed. But don't despair! Richard learns the importance of patience and perseverance, and baby Mittens is at last returned to his rightful owner.<p> Originally published in 1937, Mittens is a nostalgic tale that transcends the decades to charm a whole new generation of readers.

I&#x2019;m confident saying that even though every day, we are aging. But the truth is, we don&#x2019;t have to feel old. To me, getting &#x201c;old&#x201d; means the deterioration of your health accompanied by declining energy levels, loss of sexual function, and loss of your zest for life. I don&#x2019;t want any part of that for myself or my patients, and I bet that you don&#x2019;t, either.<br> <br>It has now been fifteen years since I began my complete physical transformation. What&#x2019;s so exciting to me is that what I accomplished in just a few months has lasted. Today, not only do I feel great, I&#x2019;ve been able to maintain my physique and my good health over all these years. In fact, in many ways, I&#x2019;m stronger, healthier, and more fit than I was when I first got into shape.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve been able to stay strong and lean, reduce my cholesterol levels, reduce internal or &#x201c;silent&#x201d; inflammation, reduce blood sugar levels, eliminate biomarkers for heart attack and stroke, and avoid diabetes. I have actually stopped the progression of heart disease that, unknown to me, had started when I was in my twenties. I have the mental focus, clarity, and sharpness necessary to keep me more productive and creative than ever. At 74 I&#x2019;m in love with my wife, working every day building my medical practice, writing best-selling books, training with elite athletes, riding my Harley, playing with my grandkids, and learning more about exercise, nutrition, and preventive medicine. I love my life!<br> <br>But back in 1998, my future did not look as bright. When I discovered that my own hormone levels were deficient, traditional medicine said that andropause, or declining testosterone, is not a disease but a fact of life, so it shouldn&#x2019;t be treated. When I was losing muscle tissue and strength to sarcopenia, conventional doctors once again said to just accept that I was getting older, and basically, just get over it. But even 15 years ago, I knew that they were wrong. The sad part is, most men continue to hear this same message from their doctors even today.<br> <br>What most docs still don&#x2019;t get is that aging is not the enemy, and it&#x2019;s not a disease. In fact, by its very definition, aging is a gradual change in your body that doesn&#x2019;t result from disease. Disease is the deviation or interruption of the normal function of any part or system of your body. Each of us has a unique set of inherited predispositions for certain health issues: That&#x2019;s your DNA code. On top of that, your lifestyle choices contribute to whether these tendencies will materialize. Lifestyle can definitely trump genetics. So instead of accepting disease or waiting for it to appear, you can learn how to use my health strategies to keep your body metabolically and physiologically in balance. That&#x2019;s the Life Plan.<br> The Philosophy Behind the Medicine<p></p> <br>I do not accept as fact traditional medicine&#x2019;s proclamation that there&#x2019;s nothing we can do about &#x201c;natural declines&#x201d; that occur as we get older, when in fact there&#x2019;s everything we can do about them. When I was on The Doctors Show in 2012, the producers cleverly built the segment not only around my book, but around my name. I think the acronym they created really sums up my philosophy (and I wish I&#x2019;d thought of it myself). This book teaches you how to master these four core areas as we age:<br> <br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;L&#x2014;Levels of hormones: Reversing hormone deficiencies keeps you energized, vibrant, and healthy. Declining hormone levels are the result of a disease process, not aging, and should be treated. In my opinion it&#x2019;s malpractice for doctors to ignore declining hormone levels and write them off as an acceptable part of aging. Study after study has shown that increasing testosterone and other critical hormone levels in deficient adults greatly affects health in many positive ways, from improving bone mineral density, sexual function, libido, and body composition to reducing risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. An optimal level of testosterone can actually decrease or eliminate Metabolic Syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure and cholesterol. And testosterone is not the only hormone you need to be concerned with: Later in the book you&#x2019;ll learn about all of the hormones that you need to be tested for, and how to enhance existing levels if necessary.<br> <br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;I&#x2014;Insulin control: Maintaining low insulin levels keeps you from getting fat and cascading into poor health, so it&#x2019;s critical to learn how to manage it through diet. Many researchers believe that high levels of insulin cause the other components of Metabolic Syndrome to develop&#x2014;obesity, high triglycerides, elevated blood pressures, and inflammation. Excess levels of insulin are also thought to be the single most important factor that accelerates the aging process. High insulin levels affect your percent body fat, blood lipid levels, glucose tolerance, aerobic capacity, muscle mass, strength, and immune function. However, when you structure a nutrition program around keeping blood sugars and insulin levels in check as I have, you will get a huge benefit beyond improved health&#x2014;increased muscle size. In just four to seven days of eating &#x201c;clean&#x201d; you can move your blood sugar and insulin levels toward their ideal range, and by two weeks you will no longer be plagued by feelings of hunger, depravation, and cravings. You&#x2019;ll experience a marked improvement in your mental focus, exercise endurance, strength, optimal health, muscularity, and leanness. These are the reasons why my diet plans are all structured to lower insulin levels.<br> <br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;F&#x2014;Food as fuel: The foods we eat can change our lives by providing constant energy and promoting good health. Your current diet may be filled with processed foods, unhealthy proteins, and sugar-laden simple carbohydrates that all taste great but really accelerate aging. All these bad foods are quickly stored as body fat and arterial plaque. They also suck the energy right out of you, add weight, and create the perfect conditions for stroke, diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. Always remember, what you put into your mouth can either hurt you or help you. I&#x2019;ll teach you how to change the way you eat so that you can begin to lose weight and reverse your potential for illness.<br> <br>&#x25a0;&nbsp;E&#x2014;Exercise: A comprehensive exercise program can not only transform our bodies, but improve our thinking and even our sex lives with just one hour of working out a day. One goal of the Life Plan is preserving bone density and enhancing muscle tissue growth. Without it, the average American male can expect to gain approximately one pound of body fat every year between ages 30 and 60 and lose about a half pound of muscle mass each year over the same period. At age 60 and onward it gets even worse as the rise in body fat replaces muscle mass. The largest loss of muscle mass occurs between ages 50 and 75, averaging 25 to 30 percent.<br> The 10 Biggest Myths Surrounding Men&#x2019;s Health<p></p> <br>Healthy aging specialists like me are dedicated to the science of healthy aging. We emphasize the enhancement of health over the treatment of illness, focusing on disease prevention, wellness, and quality of life. This approach is based on the fact that today, the majority of men already possess a genetic makeup that will allow us to live well beyond age 85. The key is to make the best of the genes we have so that we can live better, longer. By incorporating these practices into our daily lives we can reverse illness and compress the time we are sick. As I like to tell my patients, we can&#x2019;t stop the aging process, but we can definitely manage it.<br> <br>Even still, there are many misconceptions that surround men&#x2019;s health, and particularly healthy aging. These myths do nothing but hold men back, and frankly, we need to get rid of them. Another aspect of my philosophy is being completely up to date with the medical literature and backing up all my recommendations with peer-reviewed, evidence-based research studies.<br> <br>1.&nbsp;Growth hormone therapy and testosterone therapy are the same as steroid abuse by athletes: Completely false. Bodybuilders and athletes who use testosterone replacement therapy to enhance their performance are illegally (and dangerously) using hormone therapy in a manner not intended, because they are taking too much and are most probably not deficient. In fact, I&#x2019;ll bet the illegal users aren&#x2019;t getting tested for hormonal deficiencies, but are merely using the drug to ramp up their testosterone levels to as much as 10 to 20 times higher than the upper limits of the healthy range.<br> <br>Testosterone replacement therapy needs clinical supervision. Because illegal users&#x2019; levels aren&#x2019;t monitored via periodic blood work, the concentration of testosterone in their system can reach hazardous levels. However, clinically supervised testosterone replacement therapy for the purpose of counteracting hormone deficiencies and promoting good health is safe and effective, with minimal side effects.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s also important to remember that growth hormone and testosterone therapies are prescribed to prevent disease and reverse disease; they will not help you grow muscles and get ripped. I look the way I do because I spend hours at the gym each week working out. This is the most common misconception: that by taking these hormones men can build muscle and get rid of body fat. However, I will say that what hormone replacement therapy has done for me typifies what it has done for my patients. It has helped me create an optimal environment within my body, a healthy environment of hormones that are at healthy levels, which has enabled me to maximize all the training that I do, all the cardio and resistance training and flexibility training, so that I can look like I do at age 74. If I just did all the training and had low hormone levels, I wouldn&#x2019;t look anything like I do now. If I did no training and just took hormones, I wouldn&#x2019;t look anything like I do now.<br> <br>It is very likely that the same young, professional athletes who are abusing hormone therapies are also working out at elite levels every day. These guys train at such intense levels that to some extent it&#x2019;s questionable whether their athletic performance really benefits from growth hormone or testosterone replacement therapy. I do believe that these therapies make them feel psychologically better and probably allow them to train harder and have fewer injuries. At the same time I know that they are putting themselves at great risk for potentially serious medical problems.<br> <br>One of the big complaints my patients share with me is that when they start the program, and are going to the gym after not working out for a very long while, it takes them a few days just to recover from just one workout session. Once I correct their hormone deficiencies, that all goes away and they can recover more rapidly, which allows them to work out more often and at a higher level.<br> <br>2.&nbsp;Testosterone therapy causes cancer of the prostate and testicles, and other serious health concerns: Simply wrong! In fact, reversing testosterone deficiencies is one of the key ways to prevent these and other types of cancers. This unfortunate myth has steered the medical community in the wrong direction for 70 years. It started with a 1941 journal article that reported that testosterone injections increased the rate of prostate cancer growth, and that castration decreased it. Yet the problem wasn&#x2019;t with testosterone, it was with the study: It was based on only one patient! Subsequent studies have failed to link elevated testosterone levels with increased risk of prostate cancer. In fact, one large longitudinal study found just the opposite to be true&#x2014;low testosterone levels were a risk factor for prostate cancer.<br> <br>Another frequently repeated myth is that testosterone replacement therapy increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. Not so. Again, it&#x2019;s just the opposite. The heart has the highest concentration of testosterone receptors in the body, so testosterone has a huge impact on heart health. Men with healthy testosterone levels have fewer cardiovascular issues and lower mortality rates than those with deficiencies. Other studies link optimal levels of testosterone to reduced risk of coronary artery disease and hypertension, as well as improved cardiac function for those with preexisting heart disease. Older men who undergo testosterone replacement therapy typically see a decrease in LDL and overall cholesterol levels. On the flip side, low testosterone levels have been associated with increased atherosclerosis.<br> <br>3.&nbsp;Men don&#x2019;t experience anything like menopause: While men don&#x2019;t experience a precipitous fall in hormone levels that causes noticeable symptoms as women do, they absolutely do lose hormones as they age, and the results can be just as devastating. The male version of menopause, known as andropause or late-onset hypogonadism, is not yet universally recognized by the medical community, but its effects are all too real. Men begin to experience a gradual decline in testosterone and other hormones starting in our thirties. By our forties, we may start to feel the effects: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased bone density, fatigue, weight gain, loss of muscle mass and strength, even anxiety or depression.<br> <br>A traditional doctor may shrug off these complaints as the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; signs and symptoms of aging and leave it at that. Such medical practices are what perpetuate the myth that andropause isn&#x2019;t real.<br> <br>Or they may check your testosterone level and&#x2014;finding it to be in the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; range&#x2014;allow the problem to go untreated. However, the problem lies in the definition of &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; The reference range is between 300 and 1,000 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dl). A testosterone &#x201c;deficiency&#x201d; is characterized by levels below 200 ng/dl. So if your tested levels are above 200, the traditional physician may think your testosterone levels are fine. The reality is that a low borderline-&#x201c;normal&#x201d; test result is equivalent to a D-minus on your report card. Raising your testosterone level to the upper normal range of 700&#x2013;1,100 is what I look to achieve for my patients, and you shouldn&#x2019;t settle for less either. By reversing hormone loss, you&#x2019;ll reverse the symptoms of andropause and the diseases that accompany it.<br> <br>4.&nbsp;Men cannot increase muscle mass and strength as they get older: Nothing could be further from the truth. I&#x2019;ve gained 10 pounds of muscle in the last two years just by doing the right kind of exercise, eating clean, and making sure my hormone levels are at the top end of the normal range. The Life Plan is meant to make sure that we avoid losses of muscle tissue and strength as we age. You&#x2019;ll first learn how to get back into exercise safely so that you can begin to build muscle and get stronger, which will help protect your health for years to come. Then, by following this program, you&#x2019;ll quickly start to see results as you get leaner and more ripped, which will motivate you to make exercise an integral part of your life.<br> <br>The truth is that men need to increase muscle mass in order to combat sarcopenia, a condition marked by muscle atrophy and loss that typically begins in your thirties and worsens as you age. If you don&#x2019;t exercise properly, muscle loss will progress at the rate of 3 to 5 percent with each decade starting in your thirties and forties, then increase to 10 to 20 percent every decade after that.<br> <br>5.&nbsp;Declining sexual function or interest (libido) is a normal part of aging: If you want to use this as your excuse, go ahead. But I&#x2019;ll show you how to have ...</p><h2>The Scarlet Ruse</h2><p>Travis McGee is too busy with his houseboat to pay attention to the little old man with the missing postage stamps.

The medieval world was torn apart, and not just European religion, but thought, culture, society, state systems, personal relations - everything - was turned upside-down. Just about everything which followed in European history - and because of the Pilgrim Fathers, in America too - can be traced back in one way or another to the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation which it provoked. This is where the modern world painfully and dramatically began. These key events in European history are examined in this volume.</p><p>Diarmaid MacCulloch wrote what is widely considered to be the authoritative account of the Reformation&#x2014;a critical juncture in the history of Christianity. "It is impossible to understand modern Europe without understanding these sixteenth-century upheavals in Latin Christianity," he writes. "They represented the greatest fault line to appear in Christian culture since the Latin and Greek halves of the Roman Empire went their separate ways a thousand years before; they produced a house divided." The resulting split between the Catholics and Protestants still divides Christians throughout the Western world. It affects interpretations of the Bible, beliefs about baptisms, and event how much authority is given to religious leaders. The division even fuels an ongoing war. What makes MacCulloch's account rise above previous attempts to interpret the Reformation is the breadth of his research. Rather than limit his narrative to the actions of key theologians and leaders of the era&#x2014;Luther, Zingli, Calvin, Loyola, Cranmer, Henry VIII and numerous popes&#x2014;MacCulloch sweeps his narrative across the culture, politics and lay people of Renaissance Western Europe. This broad brush approach touches upon many fascinating discussions surrounding the Reformation, including his belief that the Latin Church was probably not as "corrupt and ineffective" as Protestants tend to portray it. In fact, he asserts that it "generally satisfied the spiritual needs of the late medieval people." As a historical document, this 750-page narrative has all the key ingredients. MacCulloch, a professor of history as the Church of Oxford University, is an articulate and vibrant writer with a strong guiding intelligence. The structure is sensible&#x2014;starting with the main characters who influenced reforms, then spreading out to the regional concerns, and social intellectual themes of the era. He even fast forwards into American Christianity&#x2014;showing how this historical era influences modern times. MacCulloch is a topnotch historian&#x2014;uncovering material and theories that will seem fresh and inspired to Reformation scholars as well as lay readers. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Diarmaid MacCulloch is a Fellow of St. Cross College, Oxford, and Professor of the History of the Church at Oxford University.</p><h2>The Cow of No Color: Riddle Stories and Justice Tales from Around the World</h2><p>In this outstanding multicultural collection from the authors of the prizewinning <i>While Standing on One Foot</i>, readers must try to outsmart evil kings, answer questions from Death, even puzzle with angels over the justice of God.

Jaffe and Zeitlin offer a collection of 23 brief stories intended to make readers ask themselves: What would I do or say? What is fair or just? When should mercy temper justice? After a brief note that sets the story in its cultural context, each tale is told up to the point where a character makes a decision or takes action. Then the editors step in (in italics) and ask readers to reflect. This intrusion might be distracting to some, but it clarifies the dilemma and provides a break to initiate discussion. The stories are grouped into categories such as "Poetic Justice" and "Forgiveness and Mercy." Most of the selections are folktales but there are also true stories and one taken off the Internet. Source notes and a bibliography provide more information. Sherman's slightly surreal pen-and-ink illustrations appear every few pages. This collection might appeal to teachers and counselors, religious educators, storytellers, and youngsters fond of George Shannon's less weighty but still thought-provoking collections.

Our public schools breed apathy and ignorance. Politics has become the art of the quick fix. But one woman has the vision and money to leverage change. Mariesa Gorley van Huyten, heiress to one of the great American fortunes, founds an educational subsidiary - Mentor Academies - and begins to subcontract public school systems in order to raise a new, less cynical generation. But her clandestine program is much larger, including the founding of a private space program, the eventual construction of an orbital power station, and supporting technological innovation on Earth.<br>Firestar is a chronicle of private enterprise and individual initiative - the story of one woman's quest that becomes the focus for a whole new world of the future. Her program lets teachers strive to teach, hires astronauts who have no government space program to fly for, and provides productive outlets for the idealistic desires of the rich and powerful - at least those who remain sane enough to have such desires in the face of a crumbling America.

To esteemed scholar and author Marshall Berman, it is also the flashing, teeming, and strangely beautiful nexus of his life. In this remarkable book, Berman takes us on a thrilling illustrated tour of Times Square, revealing a landscape both mythic and real. On the Town is a unique look through the lens of the ideas and works of art that inspired&#x2013;or were inspired by&#x2013;this landmark&#x2019;s allure.<br>Times Square pulses with life, drawing countless millions who long to be surrounded by too many in the midst of too much. Beyond the immense crowds, the intoxicating lights, the imposing architecture, and even the recent incursion of corporate headquarters that limn the Square&#x2019;s present boundaries, there is an indefatigable humanity (and undeniable sexual tension) that, for more than a century, has nourished creative expression. <br>Interleafing his own recollections with astute social commentary, Berman reveals how movies, graphic arts, literature, popular music, television, and, of course, the Broadway theater have reflected Times Square&#x2019;s voluminous light to illuminate a vast spectrum of themes and vignettes. Berman shows us Times Square as it is seen in Alfred Eisenstadt&#x2019;s iconic photography, the movies of Busby Berkeley, John Schlesinger, and Martin Scorsese, and the stage choreography of Jerome Robbins. <br>Conversely, we see how Times Square&#x2019;s distinctive aura finds its source in a stunningly diverse list of performers, writers, and impresarios, including Theodore Dreiser, Florenz Ziegfeld, Ethel Merman, Al Jolson, Bob Dylan, and Bruce Springsteen. Berman also celebrates the unsung heroes of Times Square&#x2013;the artists, engineers, and hucksters behind the Square&#x2019;s landmark signs that, throughout the decades, re-created raging waterfalls, blew smoke rings, bathed onlookers in the Square&#x2019;s eerily welcoming light, and projected the image of what Americans want to be against a surface of who we really are. <br>Part love letter, part revelatory semiotic exposition of a place known to all, On the Town is a nonstop excursion to the heart of American civilization, written by one of our keenest, most entertaining cultural observers.</p><p>Marshall Berman is Distinguished Professor of Political Science at City College of New York and CCNY Graduate Center, where he teaches political theory and urban studies.

When he reached 42nd Street, the fire signs were already blazing bright.<br><br> &#x2014;Hurstwood, near the end of Sister Carrie<br><br> Great signs&#x2014;Bigger! Than! Life!&#x2014;blink off and on. And a great hungry sign groping luridly at the darkness screams:<br><br> F*A*S*C*I*N*A*T*I*O*N<br><br> &#x2014;John Rechy, City of Night<br><br> Signs Square<br><br> All through the century, whenever people have talked about Times Square, they have talked about its giant signs. Those signs were there at the Square&#x2019;s very start, and for its whole life they have been designed and arranged to overwhelm the people on the ground. &#x201c;A spectacular&#x201d; is the word for these signs. Over the years they have run fifty, sixty, seventy feet high, sometimes a whole block long. They have been extravagantly lit with whatever the state of advertising art allows: with thousands of bulbs, with lovely neon calligraphy, with tremendous spotlights, with throbbing and exploding computer graphics; any style, any technology will do if it can knock us out. I don&#x2019;t mean to say that all Times Square signs are giants bent on knockout blows. Most are not; most are likely to be much smaller and more nuanced. But the Square&#x2019;s ecology is such that the smaller signs are experienced in relation to the big ones. The manager of the Arrow Shirts shop said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just below the waterfall.&#x201d; They make limited claims on the universe, but &#x201c;Side by side, they&#x2019;re glorified&#x201d; by the unlimited claims being made just above and around them.<br><br> In its effusion of signs, New York has never been alone. Early in the twentieth century, every city had its &#x201c;Great White Way.&#x201d;1 Most of these went dark after World War Two, when the Federal Highway System engineered the destruction of downtowns all over the country; New York alone survived to tell the tale. Many American cities, especially in the Sun Belt, developed prosperity based on highways and cars, and created spaces with signs as big and bold as Times Square&#x2019;s. But those spaces tend to be strips (Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Mexico City) where people come in cars and drive straight through. Their signs are laid out in straight lines, meant to be seen one or at most two at a time by drivers or passengers on the road. The deployment of signs in Times Square is far more complex. Here people are on their feet, enveloped by crowds of walkers in a hundred directions, impeded from moving straight ahead even if they want to. The signs come at us from many directions; they color the people next to us in complex blends, and we become colored, too, all of us overlaid with the moving lights and shadows. We metamorphose as we turn around, and we have to turn around to make any headway in this crowd. The development of Cubism in the early twentieth century was made for spaces like this, where we occupy many different points of view while standing nearly still. Times Square is a place where Cubism is realism. Being there is like being inside a 1920s Cubist experimental film: &#x201c;The Man with the Movie Camera&#x201d; as a home movie. Signs are the essential landmark, yet generally what grips our hearts is less any one sign than the complex, the totality, the superabundance of signs, too many signs, a perfect complement for the Square&#x2019;s too many people. Since the 1890s, being attuned to Times Square&#x2019;s overfullness has been one of the basic ways of being at home in New York. Even the most wretched people can feel at home with the Square&#x2019;s signs. &#x201c; &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll just go down Broadway,&#x2019; &#x201d; Hurstwood says. &#x201c;When he reached 42nd Street, the fire signs were already blazing bright.&#x201d; This man is starving, freezing, dressed in rags, delirious, one foot in the grave. But he can&#x2019;t stay away from the &#x201c;fire signs.&#x201d; He is drawn to their warmth and light like a moth to a flame.<br><br> Times Square&#x2019;s allure springs from the totality, the superabundance of signs, rather than from any one. But it makes sense for a book on the Square to contain at least a brief historical sweep of the Square&#x2019;s memorable signs, which will also be a sweep through modern commercial mass culture. There is another reason. One important way in which people have always experienced Times Square, and still do, has been to adopt a favorite sign, to be alone with it, to make it part of their inner lives. This means uncoupling the sign from whatever commodity it was meant to promote and placing it in a different system of meaning all our own. If the sign is a human figure, we can talk: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a sweetheart like you doing in a place like this?&#x201d; The human capacity to give things new names is a capacity not to be swept away by floods of commodities, not to be reduced to passive acquiescence, keeping ourselves inwardly, imaginatively alive. (Yet often, just when we feel at home with our special signs, we come and they are gone. &#x201c;All that is solid melts into air.&#x201d;)<br><br> One of Times Square&#x2019;s most arresting early spectaculars was the fifty-foot-tall Miss Heatherbloom, promoting &#x201c;Heatherbloom Petticoats, Silk&#x2019;s Only Rival.&#x201d; The product seems to have been a typical garment-center knockoff of a high-fashion item, marketed to millions of young women of the sort who passed through the Square every day: typists and switchboard operators, schoolteachers and young wives. The sign was built in the 1900s (different sources give different dates) by O. J. Gude, the Square&#x2019;s first great commercial artist, who painted in bursts and undulations of electric power. It had an elaborately programmed sequence where the heroine walked through a driving rain &#x201c;depicted by slashing diagonal lines of lamps.&#x201d; The wind whipped at her dress, lifted her skirt, and revealed the petticoat clinging to her legs and her hips and her thighs. The gale receded, her clothes fell into place, she resumed her high-heeled, mincing walk&#x2014;only to be swept up in the wind and rain again, and again and again.2<br><br> This sign attracted big crowds, and the crowds included plenty of women. Not the most affluent women, who would surely have stuck with silk, a warm and voluptuous material that has been a symbol of class since ancient times. But imagine seamstresses and switchboard operators on their way to work, or schoolteachers and stenographers going to plays. What the ad promised is something that the New York garment industry, just a few blocks south, knew how (and still knows how) to deliver: cheap knockoffs of expensive fabrics and designs; aristocratic fantasies that a plebeian mass public can afford. It was structurally similar to the electrified mass culture embodied in its sign. It sought and found a large body of respectable women who would respond to a public, flamboyant sexual display, and would buy a garment that they hoped would help them change.<br><br> One thing that petticoat could mean: women&#x2019;s disgust with the multiple layers of clothing that then defined women&#x2019;s wear. In those clothes, nobody would ever see what a woman&#x2019;s body looked like. (In those days, too, from what we can tell, sex happened in the dark: Touch but don&#x2019;t look.) Feminism in the early twentieth century demanded &#x201c;dress reform&#x201d; from clothes that treated women like prisoners. But not much changed till World War One, when suddenly there was a lot less cloth around, and then things changed fast. Since then, the visibility of women&#x2019;s bodies has become a primary hallmark of the twentieth century, of the West, of the big city, of modern times. Anyone who doubts this should note the rage against women&#x2019;s visibility in all the aggressively anti-modern movements around the world. The Heatherbloom product, although marketed to youth, stays firmly within the traditional layered wardrobe. But the Heatherbloom sign performs a leap into the open. It is a curtain-raiser for the century-long drama of women&#x2019;s exposure and display. This is &#x201c;legitimate&#x201d; theater because the girl can&#x2019;t help it. She does not take her clothes off; she is not stripped by a lustful husband or boyfriend; she is undressed by the primal force of nature itself. But in Times Square it is also comic theater. Its comic irony is defined by the program of the sign: In Act One the heroine is swept up and stripped by the storm; in Act Two the storm abates and her clothes cover her up; in Act Three she is out in the storm again.<br><br> Smoke, Water, and America<br><br> The discourse of nostalgia in Times Square often gravitates toward the 1940s, the age of World War Two and its prosperous aftermath. Survivors and memoirists of these years portray a New York that may have been physically distinct from the rest of America, but that culturally blended in with it, and that had the capacity to incarnate it. In Alfred Eisenstadt&#x2019;s Life photograph of the sailor and the nurse embracing in the Square as the Japanese surrender, we see a historical moment free of the tension between &#x201c;New York&#x201d; and &#x201c;America&#x201d; that marked American culture in the 1960s and 1970s, when I was growing up, and that was nourished by the GOP. (It peaked in President Ford&#x2019;s &#x201c;Drop Dead&#x201d; speech of 1976.) People who yearn for the Square of the 1940s are often, in Paul Simon&#x2019;s poignant words, &#x201c;looking for America.&#x201d; They still feel vast distance between New York and America today, and they yearn for a fusion between them that they think existed yesterday. They often focus on the Square&#x2019;s spectacular signs, which they feel performed feats of spiritual integration.<br>...</p><h2>Break The Bodies, Haunt The Bones</h2><p><b>&#x201c;[T]his novel is extraordinary . . .

He is also the winner of the 2014 Calvino Prize judged by Robert Coover, the 2016 Arts and Letters Prize judged by Kate Christensen, and the 2015 Wabash Prize judged by Kelly Link. His stories and essays have appeared in dozens of magazines ranging from the<i> New York Times</i> to <i>Lightspeed</i> to the<i> Kenyon Review</i>. Hicks teaches creative writing at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.&#x201c;Hicks&#x2019;s wildly atmospheric and unsettling debut is a heady fusion of horror, Southern gothic, and timely social commentary. [...] Hicks, a gifted storyteller, explores the crushing loss of hope and the dark heart of fear. Corporate greed is highlighted, and Henry&#x2019;s hardworking creations are obvious stand-ins for immigrants. Alongside the metaphor is real racial tension: Jane and her family are African-American and are targets of prejudice. Hicks&#x2019;s surreal, often grim vision is not without hope, even if it must come in the bloody wake of tragedy. Fans of the macabre will be enthralled.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Daring readers with a hunger for the arcane and the New Weird style of writers like China Mi�ville will enjoy this singularly strange novel.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i><b>Booklist</b></i><br><br> &#x201c;[T]his novel is extraordinary: not just an early candidate for the best horror novel of the year, but one we can present a good case for declaring a transcendent, committed and riveting novel for this historical moment... It is Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s <i>The Jungle</i>, mixed with H.G. Wells&#x2019;s <i>The Island of Doctor Moreau</i>, set in the creepiest screwed-up town since Salem&#x2019;s Lot... Micah Dean Hicks has produced a major achievement.&#x201d;--<b>Adam-Troy Castro, Sci-Fi Magazine</b><br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about this book.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s a haunting story that burrows under your skin like an insect laying eggs that hatch within you in the middle of the night. Hick&#x2019;s mesmerizing imagery kept me turning the pages and asking myself &#x201c;How is this book happening? What sort of literary witchcraft am I witnessing?&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Maurice Broaddus</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Buffalo Soldier</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Usual Suspects</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A tour-de-force of the imagination. Hicks has created a world that is beautifully and brutally surreal and yet, at the same time, BREAK THE BODIES, HAUNT THE BONES stands as a hyper-realistic psychological portrait of the death of the American factory town. My own identity as an American was disturbed and changed by this novel; some dormant understanding was shaken awake. This is a stunning and profound debut.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Julianna Baggott</b>, bestselling author of <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book&nbsp;<i>Pure</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Break the Bodies, Haunt the Bones</i>&nbsp;is a breathless wonder of a debut novel. Amid robots and a city of pigs and residents haunted by their own personal ghosts, Micah Dean Hicks explores economic uncertainty, the violence of bigotry and hate, and the tremendous weight of the past. In Swine Hill, no one escapes the horrors of grief. And yet this is a novel infused with hope, and with the most gorgeous sentences evoking the sublime wonder of this world. Hicks is a magician with words and has written a spellbinding, haunting and necessary book.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Anne Valente</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hicks&#x2019; debut novel is a thoughtful tour of the rotted and haunted heart of America.&nbsp;Highly recommended.&#x201d; &#x2014;Shirley Jackson Award-nominated author&nbsp;<b>Jeremiah Tolbert</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In&nbsp;Break the Bodies Haunt the Bones, Micah Dean Hicks has crafted a haunting story with multi-generational appeal, where the very real horror of poverty meets supernatural horror, and social issues like xenophobia, racism and economic anxiety are addressed organically through allegory and gripping storytelling. I finished this book three nights ago and still feel the chill of Swine Hill in my bones.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Chris L.

(A Cold Storage Novel)</h2><p><b> From the wild and wonderful mind of Shamus Award&#x2013;winning author John Straley comes a poetic masterpiece that explores the ugly truths of the prison industrial complex, the crumbling state of humanity, the role memory plays in the formation of the self, and much more.<br></b> <br>It&#x2019;s been seven years since Gloomy Knob landed in the Ted Stevens High-Security Federal Penitentiary and five years since the end of the war, the one North Korea started when they sent a missile to Cold Storage, Alaska. Serving a life sentence for the murder of his sister, Gloomy spends histime trying to forget about the past. <br><br> Then one day, Gloomy is snatched from his off-site work station. Instead of celebrating his newfound freedom, Gloomy comes unmoored&#x2014;he feels he belongs in prison. But his kidnappers believe Gloomy knows where a second nuclear warhead is hidden and demand to know where it is. The clock is ticking, and Gloomy knows he needs to find the missing warhead fast, or his wife, his friends, and the entire town of Cold Storage will be obliterated. The only problem is he has no idea where it is. <br><br>As Gloomy struggles to escape, the memories he fought hard to repress begin to creep out from the strange corners of his mind, first in rivulets, then in waves. In a drug-induced haze, Gloomy makes a discovery that may just bring him the closure he desires&#x2014;if it doesn&#x2019;t kill him first.</p><p>John Straley was born in Redwood City, California. He received a BA in English from the University of Washington, but settled in Sitka, Alaska, with his wife, Jan, a prominent whale biologist. John worked for thirty years as a criminal defense investigator, and many of the characters in his books were inspired by his work. Now retired, he lives with his wife in a bright green house on the beach and writes in his weathertight office overlooking Old Sitka Rocks. The former Writer Laureate of Alaska, he is the author of ten novels, including<i> Cold Storage, Alaska </i>and the Shamus Award-winner <i>The Woman Who Married a Bear,</i> the first Cecil Younger investigation.<b>Praise for <i>What Is Time to a Pig?</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;John Straley creates a maddeningly insane but wholly convincing universe that fires powerfully on the level of plot. But&nbsp;<i>What Is Time to a Pig?&nbsp;</i>does much more. It manages to skillfully ask questions about the nature of reality, memory, and dreams while speculating on what may become of our addiction to incarcerating our fellow brothers and sisters. The result is the best kind of intellectual head trip.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Sergio de la Pava, author of&nbsp;<i>A Naked Singularity&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Lost Empress</i></b><br><br>"John Straley is a masterful storyteller, and one of America's finest novelists. In&nbsp;<i>What Is Time to a Pig?&nbsp;</i>Straley captures an American society of dysfunction and a corrections system run amok, a not so distant future that we can only hope we never see. Straley delivers humor and heart with a hard punch to the gut. His quirky characters live and breathe on the page with such life and force you feel like you&#x2019;re in the room with them. I can&#x2019;t answer the question of&nbsp;<i>What is time to pig?</i>&#x2014;but I can say the time I spent devouring Straley&#x2019;s new Cold Storage novel was the best reading experience I&#x2019;ve had all year.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Don Rearden, author of the <i>Washington Post </i>notable novel&nbsp;<i>The Raven&#x2019;s Gift</i></b> <br><br>&#x201c;This is one of those books where the writing is so dazzling the story almost doesn&#x2019;t matter, but the story is wonderful too: a satirical 21st century thriller that&#x2019;s both a page-turner and the frame for a much deeper contemplation. Straley&#x2019;s prose is achingly perceptive, cinematically vivid and just pure pleasure to read.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Scott Hawkins, author of <i>The Library at Mount Char</i></b> <br><br>&#x201c;When a master writer like John Straley comes at you with a book as funny, biting, intelligent, gritty, and propulsive as <i>What Is Time to a Pig?</i>, you can&#x2019;t help but sit up and take notice. Upon a foundation of nuclear proliferation, the Ghost Dance movement, the history and future of Alaska, and the philosophical ramifications of individual freedom, Straley has built a narrative as absurd as anything in today's news cycle, and all told in his signature voice: warm, inviting, sharp, witty, and impossible to turn away from.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Christian Kiefer, author of <i>Phantoms</i></b> <br><b><i><br></i></b> &#x201c;<i>What Is Time to a Pig? </i>represents a giant leap of imagination for John Straley.

With trademark wit, Straley employs first-class storytelling skills, leading readers from <i>What will happen next?</i> to <i>What is happening right now?&nbsp;</i>Readers who follow Straley&#x2019;s intriguing characters find themselves contemplating deep human concerns: personal faith, an uncaring justice system, eroticism, politics, torture, nuclear war, repressed memory, and forgiveness.

This new edition sits alongside george&#39;s marvellous medicine, james and the giant peach, the twits, fantastic mr fox and charlie and the chocolate factory, also in full colour, paperback editions. Matilda wormwood is an extraordinary genius with really stupid parents. Miss trunchbull is her terrifying headmistress who thinks all her pupils are rotten little stinkers. But matilda will show these horrible grown-ups that even though she&#39;s only small, she&#39;s got some very powerful tricks up her sleeve . . . Matilda is also a phenomenally successful, award-winning london stage musical, adapted for the stage by dennis kelly with music by tim minchin. Roald dahl is the world&#39;s number one storyteller, with global sales of over 100 million. Born in llandaff, wales in 1916, his books are still loved by millions all over the world, despite his death in 1990. Quentin</p><p>Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. ("The") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.<p> She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable--the big surprise comes when Matilda discovers a new, mysterious facet of her mental dexterity. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts, she has real feelings. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p>Quentin Blake is one of Britain&#39;s most successful illustrators.

As he joins them on their quest, Proteus soon discovers that he is not like other members of the crew. Proteus is capable of inhuman strength; he seems never to grow tired; he has unexplainable control of the sea that surrounds him, and he is able to see things that no one else can. But, there seems to be a dark side to his past he still can&#x2019;t remember, for a number of enemies sent by Jason&#x2019;s arch nemesis, King Pelias, seems to recognize Proteus . . . as being one of them.<br><br>With the style and skill that distinguishes him as a master of the genre, Fred Saberhagen translated a classic myth for the new millennium.<br><br></p><p><br>In addition to the popular Dracula Series,<b> Fred Saberhagen</b> is the author of the popular Berserker (tm) Series and the bestselling <i>Lost Swords </i>and <i>Book of Lost Swords</i>. Fred Saberhagen lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico.<br><br>Best known for several long-running series (Berserker, Swords, Dracula), Saberhagen is now working inventive changes on Greek myths. The story of Jason and the Argonauts provides the basis for this fourth myth-based novel (after 2000's The Arms of Hercules), in which a naked man staggers out of the sea, shipwrecked and amnesiac. He knows only that his name is Proteus and that he must be part of the Argo's crew as they search for the Golden Fleece. Repairing the character's missing memory is a deft way to introduce readers to the tangle of alliances and betrayals behind the original myth. In fact, however, even readers who think they know the story will be surprised. Things don't always happen according to the myth for one thing, bystanders sometimes weren't observing carefully; for another, it's clear that super-science rather than magic underlies many of the strange events. It's impossible to say whether the book is set in an alternative past before "history" jelled or in the far future, when our history has been forgotten. Fair enough: readers should be wary as they watch gods interfering with mortals while plotting against each other and also trying to avoid hostile, superhuman giants in this bewildering, dangerous world. This isn't one of Saberhagen's best books, but the hints of hidden motives and secret powers are intriguing enough to keep fans alert for the next book in the series. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Sharp Objects</h2><p>Used.

Stephen King himself has said that he finds his early work "raw," and Brian De Palma's movie was so successful that we feel as if we have read the novel even if we never have. The simple answer is that this is a very scary story, one that works as well, if not better, on the page as it does on the screen. Carrie White, bullied by cruel teenagers at school and her religious nut of a mother at home, gradually discovers that she has telekinetic powers, powers that will eventually be turned on her tormentors. King has a way of getting under the skin of his readers by creating an utterly believable world that throbs with menace before finally exploding. He builds the tension in this early work by piecing together extracts from newspaper reports, journals, and scientific papers, as well as more traditional first- and third-person narrative in order to reveal what lurks beneath the surface of Chamberlain, Maine. <blockquote>News item from the Westover (ME) weekly Enterprise, August 19, 1966: "Rain of Stones Reported: It was reliably reported by several persons that a rain of stones fell from a clear blue sky on Carlin Street in the town of Chamberlain on August 17th."</blockquote> Although the supernatural pyrotechnics are handled with King's customary aplomb, it is the carefully drawn portrait of the little horrors of small towns, high schools, and adolescent sexuality that give this novel its power and assures its place in the King canon. <i>--Simon Leake</i>El escalofriante caso de una joven en apariencia insignificante que se transform� en un ser de poderes anormales, sembrando el terror en su ciudad.

For many years the best paid photographer of his time and a profound influence on photographers like Richard Avedon, his work was out of fashion at the time of his death in 1963. Recently, Munkacsi has emerged from history as one of the most significant talents of the twentieth century, having shaped the beginnings of modern photojournalism, set in motion a previously static medium and combined fact-finding accuracy with a highly formal aesthetic standard. Munkacsi was an outstanding representative of the &#39;Neues Sehen&#39; (New Way of Seeing), certainly photography&#39;s weightiest contribution to advanced art. His fashion and sports photography were both groundbreaking and unmatched. Up until now, however, all this work has been scattered throughout the world, and much of it has been lost, although the Ullstein Archive in Berlin maintains an extensive collection of Munkacsi&#39;s work from Hungary and Germany. Martin Munkacsi gathers and assembles this mid-century master&#39;s images as never before. It contains pictures from each of his artistic phases and several photographs and reports that haven&#39;t been seen since their initial magazine publications. A major collection featuring 318 tritones, it offers a valuable glimpse of photography&#39;s tense, technology-obsessed, glamorous and contradictory beginnings.</p><p>F. C.

She'd believed in it once, too, back when she was eighteen."</em><br><br>In the spring of 1984, high school students Amanda Collier and Dawson Cole fell deeply, irrevocably in love. Though they were from opposite sides of the tracks, their love for one another seemed to defy the realities of life in the small town of Oriental, North Carolina. But as the summer of their senior year came to a close, unforeseen events would tear the young couple apart, setting them on radically divergent paths.<br><br>Now, twenty-five years later, Amanda and Dawson are summoned back to Oriental for the funeral of Tuck Hostetler, the mentor who once gave shelter to their high school romance. Neither has lived the life they imagined . . . and neither can forget the passionate first love that forever changed their lives. As Amanda and Dawson carry out the instructions Tuck left behind for them, they realize that everything they thought they knew -- about Tuck, about themselves, and about the dreams they held dear -- was not as it seemed. Forced to confront painful memories, the two former lovers will discover undeniable truths about the choices they have made.

At that age, people are coming to terms with the decisions and choices they&#x2019;ve made in the past. <em>The Best of Me</em> was essentially a combination of those two ideas.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong>: This book deals with falling in love for the first time and how sometimes that love is so strong it can cross the span of time and space no matter what happens. Is that something you believe in?</p> <p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, I believe it&#x2019;s possible. First love is always powerful, and for some people, that love really does last forever. The problem with that, however, is that over time, the love often becomes romanticized. I wanted to write a novel that explored that concept as well. Neither Dawson nor Amanda are the same people they&#x2019;d been when they were younger, and little by little, that romanticism diminishes over the course of the story. For them, however, the new reality nonetheless left them feeling the same way about each other as they once had. And yet, they fell in love once more. Or maybe, phrasing it differently, they never fell out of love in the first place.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong>: Former high school sweethearts Amanda Collier and Dawson Cole reconnect after 25 years when their mentor, Tuck Hostetler, dies and they are summoned back to Oriental, North Carolina for his funeral. One of things that drove Amanda and Dawson apart was that they were from the opposite side of the tracks. Are class differences still a part of everyday life in a town like Oriental, North Carolina?</p> <p><strong>A</strong>: Class differences aren&#x2019;t as powerful as they once were, but they&#x2019;re still prevalent. I don&#x2019;t know, however, if it&#x2019;s limited to places like Oriental, and nor do I see it as entirely and without question a terrible thing. People who intend to spend their lives together should have things in common, and like it or not, class is, and always has been, part of that, because it shapes the people that we are.</p> <p>With Amanda and Dawson--and many others in the real world, of course--the class differences were less important than their similarities. Neither one of them got along with their parents, both were intelligent, both had dreams, and over the years, both of them had disappointments.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong>: Today, we can easily reconnect with people from our past via Facebook and other social networking sites. How often do you think people try to find their first love on these sites?</p> <p><strong>A</strong>: It&#x2019;s very common. I know people who&#x2019;ve reconnected with someone from their past then later married them, but that&#x2019;s probably less common than simply reaching out via social media to an old boyfriend or girlfriend simply to find out what&#x2019;s been going on in their lives. I can understand the draw: First love is powerful because it&#x2019;s a first, and it&#x2019;s almost impossible to forget.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong>: At the point when Amanda and Dawson reconnect, Amanda has been married almost twenty years and it&#x2019;s clear she is having problems in her marriage. Having been married for 22 years yourself, what would you say is the key to a successful marriage?</p> <p><strong>A</strong>: For every couple, it&#x2019;s different, because every couple faces different challenges, and every person has differing abilities when it comes to meeting those challenges. The key to any successful marriage is to realize that the commitment you once made to each other is the most important aspect to keep in mind. That simple truth, if truly felt, should be enough to make you realize that you can&#x2019;t put that commitment at risk. If your partner feels the same way, he or she wouldn&#x2019;t put that commitment at risk either.</p> <p>At the same time, it&#x2019;s important to understand that all marriages have challenging periods. No one is perfect, after all. But if the commitment to each other--which sometimes requires a commitment to change--is truly felt, then most likely, that marriage will be successful.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Q</strong>: This book has a large, spiritual component to it. Tuck sees Clara, his dead wife, and Dawson sees a man in a blue windbreaker, although he is not sure who he is and the reader does not find out until the end. Do you believe in ghosts?</p> <p><strong>A</strong>: I think I do. I had an experience much like the one Dawson described: at times, I could see unexplainable movement from the corners of my eyes. Quick, instantaneous movements that vanished before I could turn my head. If you talk to the owners of the house where those events occurred, they will swear it was a ghost. Other events occurred in that house as well before the &#x201c;ghost&#x201d;--or whatever it was--was finally exorcised from the premises. But that&#x2019;s a longer story for another time.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Q</strong>: There is an absolutely stunning scene that unfolds when Amanda and Dawson go to Tuck&#x2019;s country cottage for the first time. It&#x2019;s very reminiscent of a scene that happens in <em>The Notebook.</em> Would you say this book, which examines young love versus middle age love, is the book closest in sentiment to <em>The Notebook?</em></p> <p><strong>A</strong>: Without question, this is closest in sentiment--at least through the majority of the story &#x2013; when compared to The Notebook. I wanted to do exactly that. At the same time, I wanted to make everything else about the story completely different as well, and I&#x2019;m hopeful I did that as well.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Q</strong>: Tuck writes letters to Amanda and Dawson to be read after he is dead. They are wise and beautifully written. In this day and age of constant, electronic overload, do you lament the lost art of letter writing?</p> <p><strong>A</strong>: I do. I love letters as opposed to e-mail. But I&#x2019;m old-fashioned that way.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong>: Warner Bros. has already bought the film rights to <em>The Best of Me</em>. You will be a producer on this film along with Denise DiNovi. How often is an author also a producer for the movie version of a book he/she has written? Is this unprecedented?</p> <p><strong>A</strong>: I&#x2019;m sure other authors have served as a producer of their work; some have even directed. But it was somewhat unprecedented for Warner to agree to that &#x2013; and purchase the novel--before I&#x2019;d written a single page.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Q</strong>: Of all the movies based on your novels, which is your favorite?</p> <p><strong>A</strong>: I&#x2019;ve been fortunate in that all the movies have been well-done and all have been successful, so I don&#x2019;t have a personal favorite. I can say, however, is that, at the current time, The Notebook seems most likely to become a classic.</p> <p><em>Photo by Nina Subin</em></p>With over 100 million copies of his books sold, Nicholas Sparks is one of the world's most beloved storytellers.

With it the French scored a streak of historic victories that gave them an unprecedented grip on power over the European continent. At its peak it was made up of 680,000 men, a huge multi-national force of officers, infantry and cavalry, artillery and support services masterminded by a superior and highly flexible system of corps, divisions, brigades and regiments, commanded by officers in which Napoleon placed a huge degree of trust and autonomy to operate within the outlines of his strategic objectives. Looking closely at how this military machine was constructed and mobilized, <i>Napoleon's Military Machine Operations Manual</i> examines all aspects of the Grande Armee, from individual soldiers, what they wore, ate, slept in and were paid, to the chain of command, recruitment and training, intelligence and comms, and logistics and battle tactics. The legacy of Napoleon&#x2019;s army is assessed, as is how his organization and management initiatives influenced national armies around the world in ways that can still be seen today.</p><p><p><b>Chris McNa</b>b&nbsp;specializes in military history and military technology.

It faced doom at the end of the Civil War but was rescued by Gardner Colby, a wealthy manufacturer whose $50,000 donation saved the college. Three years later, it changed its name to honor its benefactor. Sixty years after that, the tiny college had become choked by the city's success. Squeezed between the Kennebec River and the railroad tracks, it faced the daunting challenge of building a larger campus. The book tells the story of that audacious move, made in the darkest days of the Great Depression and funded by Waterville's residents, who raised $100,000 for a new campus on the heights above the city--on Mayflower Hill.<br><br>The years after the move were marked by vibrant growth and daring change, leading to an institutional prominence unimagined by the founders. Using anecdotes and biographical asides to humanize this history, Earl H. Smith describes Colby's shift from a religious focus to secularism, from "coordination" to coeducation, and from provincialism to global notice. Smith tracks the growth of an ever-stronger faculty who were willing to make innovative changes in the curriculum, and of trustees who dared to revolutionize student life by shedding outdated traditions. He brings to life student voices of the 1960s and 1970s, eager to change the old rules, protest an unpopular war, and demand equality and social justice on campus and worldwide. And perhaps most important of all, Smith illuminates how Colby College slowly reversed its role from the protected to a protector of the city that saved it. <br><br>Far more than a mere institutional history, Mayflower Hill resonates with the independent spirit of its founders and of subsequent generations of presidents, trustees, faculty, and students, who took inspiration and courage from the story of the old College and carried the new Colby to its place among the finest small colleges in the land.</p><p>Waterville native EARL H. SMITH has held a variety of positions at Colby College for more than forty years, including dean of students, dean of the college, secretary of the corporation, and as an assistant and advisor to three Colby presidents. For the past three years he has served as the college&#39;s historian.&#34;Smith&#39;s narrative is scholarly, meticulous, and wordy, making this a complete reference book of Colby history, but it is also funny and interesting, offering unique insights into campus politics, struggles with growth, finances, and strong personalities. Amidst stories of campus expansion, construction, and finances, Smith also tells wonderful anecdotes about its contentious co-ed transition and fraternity management, Colby&#39;s &#39;highway war&#39; with the Maine DOT, its strange feuds with the CIA and Sen.

Set against the mean streets of L.A.'s South Bay 'hoods, the book is populated by a cast of vivid characters, including Tupac Shakur, Snoop's one true friend and musical soulmate, cut down at the beginning of a brilliant career, and Suge Knight, whose Death Row Records brought street-level credibility--and gangland tactics--into the corporate suites of the entertainment industry.<p>From the Crip gang members who recruited Snoop virtually off the playground to the pimps and players, whores and hustlers who formed his extended family on the streets and behind prison walls, Tha Doggfather offers a scathing, unexpurgated look at life on the edge in a modern urban jungle. Snoop's rise to the pinnacle of rap stardom is chronicled, along with his nearly career-ending arrest and trial for a murder he didn't commit.</p><p>Raised to the pinnacle, brought to the brink, Snoop Dogg eventually found sanity and salvation in his relationship with Shantay Taylor, his high school sweetheart. Married in 1997, the couple started a new life with their two young sons, even as Snoop's career reached new heights in his creative collaboration with Master P and No Limit Records.</p></p><p>Multiplatinum-selling gangsta rapper, serial marijuana abuser ... and God-fearing family man? That's how Snoop Dogg tells it in <i>Tha Doggfather</i>, a straightforward (by his lights, anyway) telling of his own story. From slinging crack in the ghetto of Long Beach, California, to rapping the tales that brought hip-hop to a new level commercially in the early '90s, to a murder charge that he beat in 1996, this is Snoop's story. Many of the facts won't surprise, though his candor might; the former Calvin Broadus isn't much interested in apologizing, even for things he might have done that potentially conflicted with his current goal to "increase the peace." Some of the guy's pronouncements would fit right in on the milder-mannered daytime talk shows ("God is on your side and... He cares about you trying the best you can, no matter who you are"), while others are so edgily funny he hasn't even managed to fit them into a rap ("there's nothing more dangerous than a Sherm head with an attitude," he says of those whose high of choice is a cigarette dipped in embalming fluid). Snoop cautiously criticizes now-imprisoned former Death Row Records head Suge Knight while skirting the hard questions about friend Tupac Shakur's death after a Las Vegas shooting incident. Some things, it seems, are a little hard even for tha Doggfather to ponder. <i>--Rickey Wright</i><p>Davin Seay has coauthored numerous books, including, most recently, <em>Hello Charlie</em> with Charles Hess and <em>In Justice</em> with David Iglesias.

Yet here she is&#x2014;in this new ambitious detective novel from the sure-footed Mick Herron&#x2014;worried by three of them. Zo� herself has killed a man, and self-defense or not, it cripples her emotions still. She also remembers Wez, a twelve-year-old kid afraid of heights, who tumbled to his death from the top of a tower block; she knew him when he was nine and snatching purses from middle-aged ladies. Then, there&#x2019;s Caroline Daniels. They&#x2019;re saying that Caroline&#x2019;s death was accidental: that she fell off the crowded underground platform and died beneath the wheels of an oncoming train. Nonetheless, Caroline&#x2019;s employer, Amory Grayling, is disturbed. Caroline, it seems, had recently acquired a lover who remains mysteriously faceless and nameless. So it is that Zo� begins searching for a man whom no one knows by attempting to uncover the secrets locked in the heart of a woman she has never met. Though the questions outnumber Zo�&#x2019;s answers, she is certain that Caroline did not fall accidentally to death. Nor did Wez, she comes to realize, and soon finds herself dangerously pursuing two murderers, though one of them may find her first.</p><p>Mick Herron was born in Newcastle upon Tyne and was educated there and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a degree in English literature. Since graduating he made Oxford his home and lives there still, although he now commutes into London. His first novel Down Cemetery Road was published last year by Constable to great acclaim and is now available in paperback. Mick is currently working on his third novel.&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wore black jeans, red top, a black leather jacket; she had dark curly hair and was old&#x2014;forty, fifty, somewhere round that&#x2014;with a shoulder bag that swung like an invitation: banging heavy on her hip, loaded with purses, credit cards and women&#x2019;s stuff; everything she&#x2019;d need in the big bad city. Definite out-of-towner. She should have had <i>victim</i> tattooed on her forehead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yessss . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew, who answered to Dig these days, let it out in one long breath.<i> Yessss.</i> She was the one. You waited long enough, your ticket to the party arrived. The party started tomorrow&#x2014;all around, the old millennium drained away like dirty water from a sink&#x2014;and here she was, just the ticket: a bag with a bag. Drifting down the arcade, her attention swallowed by a glittery window&#x2019;s expensive promises: they&#x2019;d have the bag, that jacket off her back even, and all she&#x2019;d ever know about it was Some You Lose. The credit cards, the money, were as good as in their pockets.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside him, Wez muttered something purple-sounding. He looked like he&#x2019;d melt in your mouth, but had a vocabulary could stop a train.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And another spat of water hit Dig&#x2019;s neck. They were leaning on one of the concrete stanchions that supported the building overhead, and once every couple of minutes enough moisture gathered up there to loosen and splash on Dig&#x2019;s neck. It would have been pussy to move because he was dripped on. So the thing was to pretend it wasn&#x2019;t happening, or if it was, that he liked it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way the woman walked&#x2014;her bag slung over one shoulder; her left hand resting lightly on its clasp&#x2014;she might never have been out of her village before.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two hundred yards up the road, the Tube swallowed travellers. Here in the arcade, pedestrian traffic was slight: the shops were a low-rent jeweller&#x2019;s, a hardware store, a CostCutter, a chemist&#x2019;s, a dry-cleaner&#x2019;s, a newsagent&#x2019;s, a bagel outlet. It was the jeweller&#x2019;s Black-and-Red faltered by. Dig had checked that window out himself: all crap, even he knew that. Naff engagement rings, and stuff, you hung it round your neck, you&#x2019;d look like Miss Piggy on a bad hair day. <i>The bigger the stone, the cheaper the lady</i> his bastard father used to say. This lady didn&#x2019;t look cheap, just old, and he wondered what she was doing here, where the shops were end-of-line, and all the expensive promises broken as soon as unwrapped. And then he thought: <i>She must have been to the concert hall</i>&#x2014;there was a concert hall tucked inside the labyrinth&#x2014;a concert hall and a museum and some other shit. Black-and-Red must have spent the afternoon doing culture, and wandered past the Tube in the hope of finding more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez said, &#x201c;Dumb fuckbunny&#x2019;s about to have a shit-fit.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dig drew on his cigarette, and breathed out heavily&#x2014;the cloud adding to the afternoon&#x2019;s mistiness; to the damp, the grime, the oil-patterned puddles at the kerbs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez said, &#x201c;Fuckin twatlegs&#x2019;ll wish she&#x2019;d stayed home,&#x201d; and threw his own cigarette into the gutter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real clouds, what showed of them above the office blocks and skyline furniture, were an angry grey mess. The pavements shone weakly, stealing light from nearby windows. Dig tugged at his top&#x2019;s broken zipper. There was smoke in the air from some distant accident, and more in his lungs from a stolen Marlboro, and water poured down his neck in a fine white wash of reality, and the woman was moving again&#x2014;coming towards them, the bag slapping happily against her hip&#x2014;and his insides clenched with the inevitability of everything, and he looked at Wez, voice hardly cracking at all when he said, &#x201c;Ready?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Wez looked pure scorn, because Wez was <i>born</i> ready, and this was his meat and drink. Was how he knew he was awake and breathing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dig freed himself from his pillar like, probably, some old statue coming to life, just as his cigarette scorched to the knuckle . . . He shook his hand and it jumped away, scattering sparks against the bagel joint&#x2019;s fogged window. This was <i>attention</i>, mad enough to get the stares coming, but the dumb bitch hadn&#x2019;t noticed; she&#x2019;d turned to look at something&#x2014;Get Two Suits Cleaned And We&#x2019;ll Clean A Third One Free!&#x2014;so missed the fireworks; missed, too, Wez&#x2019;s split-second fury&#x2014;<i>Cunt</i> he mouthed, then turned and headed towards Black-and-Red, side-stepping to her right maybe twenty foot in front. Dig watched the stub tumble cartwheels in the draught, bloom one last time against a greengrocer&#x2019;s crate, then he set off to take his place in the dance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . Once, the bitch-mother had taken him to the ballet. That was what she&#x2019;d called it: <i>The</i> ballet. He&#x2019;d thought there was only one. And it was strange how some things you carried regardless: along with a couple of scribbled-over nursery memories, and a trace of her perfume he&#x2019;d caught last night up west, he had the startling picture in his head sometimes of people producing impossible leaps and mid-air twirls; their limbs strangers to gravity, their hands gripping invisible ropes from which they swung like uncaged monkeys. <i>So beautifully choreographed, darling</i> she&#x2019;d said afterwards, practising for her friends while she lit a cigarette and stared into the crowds in the hope of somebody interesting. And: <i>So beautifully choreographed</i> he thought now, as Wez slipped the bag from the woman with a touch light as a ghost&#x2019;s, and turned and tossed it to Dig so sweetly it fell into his open arms even as he started to run&#x2014;and this was what Dig did best. This was why Wez let him hang: it was Dig&#x2019;s run; nothing to flat-out whirlwind in Point Zero. Wez tarried long enough to do the rest&#x2014;he pushed the woman sideways, with just enough footwork she hit the deck&#x2014;then took off too. But Dig was away by then; darting like his feet were on fire the length of the arcade, and up the redbrick walkway, and into the concrete labyrinth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was heavy. That was the first and most important thing: this bag was heavy. Like the bitch collected bricks or something, except whatever it was, it wasn&#x2019;t bricks, and even while he was running, imagined contents took root in his head: what did she have in here, this bottomless black leather bag with its big clasp? Maybe she was stopping in town for tomorrow&#x2019;s blast, and this held her party gear: not just the money, the credit cards, the <i>stuff</i>, but strings of jewels, diamond tiaras, lengths of precisely numbered rubies. You never knew what you&#x2019;d got till it was done. His feet had wings; they barely touched the walkway. At the top, he hit a hard left, then twisted right down a flight of steps: Dig was down them in one and a half clicks, and here came the danger&#x2014;the big sprint across open space with bricked-in flowerbeds and litter bins, overlooked on all sides by office windows&#x2014;here you could be spotted; your direction mapped; your destination guessed. He hugged the bag tighter. Today, he was winged. Today, the offices were deserted; everybody heading home, or filling the bars with their bigmouth suit-and-tie voices. He reached the shelter of the opposite side, the comfort of the next stairwell&#x2014;up now, three steps a stride, which brought him to another walkway, this one bridging a traffic-choked road to end in a mini-plaza with a wide-fronted entrance to a museum or something, closed already. He ducked a loop of builder&#x2019;s tape warning about overhead work which wasn&#x2019;t happening, and into another stairwell, and then there were only two flights to go, and he was safe&#x2014;there was a spot down here Wez had fixed on, and if Wez said it was safe, it was safe. Wez knew what was what. Dig was the legs but Wez was everything else, and both knew it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The breath was hammering out of him in short hard bursts: his heart pounding, blood racing. Everything. He was alive, and it was all working.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The safe spot was a dark corner near the intersection of two walkways one flight from the car park; a strange nook the labyrinth&#x2019;s interlocking architecture had thrown up: accident or design, didn&#x2019;t matter. It smelt appallingly of piss. Waiting, Dig hefted the bag to shoulder height. Pretty weighty, yes. But he wouldn&#x2019;t open it till Wez arrived. That was the rule. Truth told he was scared of Wez, who had no boundaries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hand on his shoulder nearly killed him. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez said, &#x201c;All be dope?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dig swallowed the cry; re-anchored his heart. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s . . . cool.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Less check the stash.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez reached and took the bag from Dig like cigarettes from a baby, but even he noted the weight&#x2014;a sudden collapse at the wrist before he could correct it, correct <i>gravity</i>, and Dig felt a quick rush of pride: he had stolen this.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She carryin fuckin stones.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not stones, Wez.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She carryin fuckin<i> leadweights</i>, dickweed.&#x201d; But there was a gleam in his eye, and Dig knew Wez didn&#x2019;t think that; that there weren&#x2019;t no leadweights here, but pirates' treasure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It be dope,&#x201d; he said, and felt the words come almost naturally; as if he were what they sounded like he were: king of the fucking streets, bigtime.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez was unzipping the bag.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A splash grabbed Dig&#x2019;s neck&#x2014;even here, buried out of reach of the weather, there was no escaping the damp.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Wez pulled out was, indeed, a brick.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of seconds they stood, looking at the brick in Wez&#x2019;s hand like it was the Ark of the Covenant. Another splash hit the stones. Wez opened his mouth. The sounds he&#x2019;d been going to make disappeared.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Dig jerked backwards, and whatever grabbed him this time was fiercer than raindrops. He made to squawk, but air vanished; it was half a second before he realized that an arm had scooped and clenched round his middle; an arm sleeved in black, with red at the cuff . . . He deflated instantly, and then his arms were wrenched back, and something snapped into place. He couldn&#x2019;t move. He couldn&#x2019;t breathe. Hands seized his collar and he was pulled backwards so abruptly he lost his footing; he was sprawling now, aching for breath. And the rain was coming down harder and he was flapping on the stones man, flapping on the fucking stones, and couldn&#x2019;t breathe, and it was the bitch with the bag, the bitch with the fucking bag, and all it held was bricks, and he couldn&#x2019;t breathe, and it was raining, and she was over him like fucking Wonder Woman or something, and if he didn&#x2019;t breathe soon he&#x2019;d fucking die . . . They were handcuffs. The bitch had fucking cuffed him. And where was Wez: Wez was still in the fucking cubby. He breathed at last. The air felt like on fire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez emerged, looking smaller, looking grey. &#x201c;Fuck you at, bitch?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She held a palm out flat, like she was stopping traffic. Then bent and pulled at Dig&#x2019;s cuffs, so he was yanked to his feet like a puppet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He still wasn&#x2019;t breathing properly. There were laws said you couldn&#x2019;t do this, couldn&#x2019;t just <i>squeeze</i> and <i>cuff</i> and <i>yank</i> people less you were a copper, and the horrible news hit him like that: she was a copper. What else was she? And his brain ran ragged, because a copper meant the beautiful game was over.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez was smiling. Dig had seen that smile before. It didn&#x2019;t signify happy. &#x201c;Muffcruncher,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Back off.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And <i>This isn&#x2019;t her</i>, thought Dig. This wasn&#x2019;t the slack-jawed woman they&#x2019;d watched trawling the arcade, carrying her bag like a victim tourist&#x2014;this voice was hard; it came from a place you didn&#x2019;t want to run into full tilt. It was a voice with rocks in it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fuckin twat merchant,&#x201d; said Wez bravely. It was as if he still didn&#x2019;t get it, but he got it. Beneath the words, Dig could hear something he&#x2019;d never heard before from Wez; never imagined he&#x2019;d hear from him. He was scared. But he was still giving it lip. &#x201c;Bitch.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was pain in Dig&#x2019;s wrists as he was pulled again: he was on his feet, and they were on the move. The woman took as much notice of Wez as if he were bruised fruit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had one hand on his collar and the other on the chain linking his wrists. He&#x2019;d twist free any second; fling her away; give her some footwork&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept marching.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And two yards back Wez danced; never getting so close he was help or hindrance. &#x201c;Dishwashin scumsucker. Gunna give you fuckin <i>grief</i> lady, gunna give you fuckin<i> ballsache</i> . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were on the stairs now; he was being pushed down the stairs, her hand firm on the cuff-chain, so he couldn&#x2019;t fall. The woman&#x2019;s hand felt like cable. Wez&#x2019;s voice wobbled after them, then his body followed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You juss fuckin <i>slice</i> bitch, you slice waitin to happen . . .&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Words tumbling out of him, and all Dig could feel, could think, was <i>It&#x2019;s over. The game is over.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hands ached, his chest ached, but at least he was breathing freely now as he was propelled in the direction of some piece-of-shit Nissan Sunny, anything less like an unmarked car he had <i>yet to fucking see</i> . . . Everything came to a halt when he was slammed against its bodywork.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting in,&#x201d; her voice said. &#x201c;And no fuss.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opened. Her hand squashing his head, he was poured into the back seat, which was what it felt like: poured. Outside, maintaining safe distance, Wez hovered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You lookin at <i>pain</i> bitch is what you lookin at . . .&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could be anybody, thought Dig. Could be some serial pervert, and the next I&#x2019;m known of, I&#x2019;ll be body parts in bags.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wez came closer while Black-and-Red made an important suggestion to Dig. &#x201c;Mark my car, and I&#x2019;m taking it out of your hide. Are we together on this?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said <i>muh</i>&#x2014;or <i>wuh</i>&#x2014;.

How do we distinguish misinformation, pseudo-facts, distortions and outright lies from reliable information? In <i>A Field Guide to Lies</i>, neuroscientist Daniel Levitin outlines the many pitfalls of the information age and provides the means to spot and avoid them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Levitin groups his field guide into two categories--statistical infomation and faulty arguments--ultimately showing how science is the bedrock of critical thinking. It is easy to lie with stats and graphs as few people "take the time to look under the hood and see how they work." And, just because there's a number on something, doesn't mean that the number was arrived at properly. Logic can help to evaluate whether or not a chain of reasoning is valid. And "infoliteracy" teaches us that not all sources of information are equal, and that biases can distort data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faced with a world too eager to flood us with information, the best response is to be prepared. <i>A Field Guide to Lies</i> helps us avoid learning a lot of things that aren't true.</p><p>Daniel J. Levitin, PhD is the James McGill Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at McGill University in Montreal&nbsp;and is dean of the College of Arts and Humanities at the Minerva Schools at KGI.

The key to <em>A Theater of Envy</em> is Rene Girard's novel reinterpretation of "mimesis." For Girard, people desire objects not for their intrinsic value, but because they are desired by someone else--we mime or imitate their desires. This envy--or "mimetic desire"--he sees as one of the foundations of the human condition.<br> Bringing such provocative and iconoclastic insights to bear on Shakespeare, Girard reveals the previously overlooked coherence of problem plays like <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, and makes a convincing argument for elevating <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> from the status of a chaotic comedy to a masterpiece. The book abounds with novel and provocative interpretations: Shakespeare becomes "a prophet of modern advertising," and the threat of nuclear disaster is read in the light of <em>Hamlet</em>. Most intriguing of all, perhaps, is a brief, but brilliant aside in which an entirely new perspective is brought to the chapter in Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> in which Stephen Dedalus gives a lecture on Shakespeare. In Girard's view only Joyce, perhaps the greatest of twentieth-century novelists, comes close to understanding the greatest of Renaissance playwrights.<br> Throughout this impressively sustained reading of Shakespeare Girard's prose is sophisticated, but contemporary, and accessible to the general reader. Anyone interested in literature, anthropology, or psychoanalysis will want to read this challenging book. And all those involved in theatrical production and performance will find <em>A Theater of Envy</em> full of suggestive new ideas.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Rene Girard</strong> is Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language, Literature and Civilization at Stanford University, where he is also Professor of Religious Studies and of Comparative Literature. His books include <em>Deceit, Desire, and the Novel</em>, <em>Violence and the Sacred</em>, and <em>The Scapegoat</em>, works for which he has received honors throughout the world.<br></p><h2>The Jungle (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics)</h2><p><i>The Jungle</i>, by <b>Upton Sinclair</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

Instead of finding the American Dream, Rudkus and his family inhabit a brutal, soul-crushing urban jungle dominated by greedy bosses, pitiless con-men, and corrupt politicians.<p>While Sinclair&#x2019;s main target was the industry&#x2019;s appalling labor conditions, the reading public was most outraged by the disgusting filth and contamination in American food that his novel exposed. As a result, President Theodore Roosevelt demanded an official investigation, which quickly led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug laws. For a work of fiction to have such an impact outside its literary context is extremely rare. (At the time of <i>The Jungle</i>&#x2019;s publication in 1906, the only novel to have led to social change on a similar scale in America was <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i>.)</p><p>Today, <i>The Jungle</i> remains a relevant portrait of capitalism at its worst and an impassioned account of the human spirit facing nearly insurmountable challenges.</p><p><b>Maura Spiegel</b> teaches literature and film at Columbia University and Barnard College. She is the coauthor of <i>The Grim Reader and The Breast Book: An Intimate and Curious History</i>. She coedits <i>Literature and Medicine</i>, a journal.</p></p><p>During his lifetime, Upton Sinclair authored dozens of books dealing with political and social questions, <i>The Coal War</i> and <i>Oil!</i> being two representative examples. Sinclair was also a socialist and political activist almost his entire adult life. After being massively outspent by business interests he narrowly missed being elected governor of California in 1936. <i>The Jungle</i>, written while he was still in his 20s, is by far his best known book.<p>An ardent activist, champion of political reform, novelist, and progressive journalist, Upton Sinclair is perhaps best known today for <i>The Jungle</i> his devastating expose of the meat-packing industry. A protest novel he privately published in 1906, the book was a shocking revelation of intolerable labor practices and unsanitary working conditions in the Chicago stockyards. It quickly became a bestseller, arousing public sentiment and resulting in such federal legislation as the Pure Food and Drug Act.-The brutally grim story of a Slavic family who emigrates to America, <i>The Jungle</i> tells of their rapid and inexorable descent into numbing poverty, moral degradation, and social and economic despair. Vulnerable and isolated, the family of Jurgis Rudkus struggles unsuccessfully to survive in an urban jungle.<br>A powerful view of turn-of-the-century poverty, graft, and corruption, this fiercely realistic American classic is still required reading in many history and literature classes. It will continue to haunt readers long after they've finished the last page."</p></p><h2>Amish Quilt Patterns</h2><p><i>This reliable favorite is newly revised for greater usefulness!

In this book, the layout of the birth chart is rendered and essential graha (planet), rashi (constellation) and bhava (house) characteristics are explained. A special chapter on advanced bhava meanings provides an in-depth examination of the 12 bhavas and presents the concept of bhavat bhavam (bhava from bhava) and bhava reflection. Included are beautiful illustrations of the 9 planetary deities and the 27 ruling godheads of the lunar nakshatras. Volume I also incorporates more advanced topics, including a comprehensive discussion of graha condition, important yogas and various confluence techniques. One of the greatest gifts of Vedic Astrology is its many predictive systems. Popular timing techniques explained in this volume include the Vimshottari system of dashas and bhuktis and Gochara (planetary transits). When the birth chart shows a potential for certain events and experiences to occur, then dashas-bhuktis and transits serve as astrological timing triggers that &#x201c;ripen&#x201d; the particular event and produce life-changing events, such as a marriage, the birth of a child, a new career path or severe illness. To make accurate predictions, we have to marry the static nature of the Vedic birth chart with dynamic timing triggers. Lastly, the biggest stumbling block for students of Vedic Astrology is where to begin the birth chart interpretation process. Without a sensible process for chart interpretation, we find our eyes gazing hopelessly at varied planetary configurations, wondering how to integrate and summarize our findings into a message that is insightful and constructive to the client. Volume I offers a comprehensive methodology developed and used successfully by the author.

Integrating history, feminist analysis, and developmental theory, the authors describe how and why women have become rock musicians&#x2015;what inspires them to play and perform, how they write, what their music means to them, and what they hope their music means to listeners. As these musicians tell their stories, topics emerge that illuminate broader trends in rock's history. From Wanda Jackson's revolutionary act of picking up a guitar to the current success of independent artists such as Ani DiFranco, <i>Girls Rock!</i> examines the shared threads of these performers' lives and the evolution of women's roles in rock music since its beginnings in the 1950s. This provocative investigation of women in rock is based on numerous interviews with a broad spectrum of women performers&#x2015;those who have achieved fame and those just starting bands, those playing at local coffeehouses and those selling out huge arenas. Girls Rock! celebrates what female musicians have to teach about their experiences as women, artists, and rock musicians.</p><p>Mina Carson, associate professor of history at Oregon State University, is the author of Settlement Folk: Social Thought and the American Settlement Movement, 1885-1930. <p>Tisa Lewis, professor of human development and Christian education at Montreat College, is the author of Faith Influences: Gospel Responsibilities in a Changing World. </p><p>Susan M.

This is followed by chapters focusing on the main plant groups and areas of the garden - from ornamental trees and perennials to water gardening and the fruit garden. Each chapter offers in-depth coverage of every aspect of soil preparation and panting, creating effective garden features, and the routine care of your plants. Part two, &#34;Maintaining the Garden&#34;, helps you to choose the garden equipment and materials, provides a practical guide to building a framework for the plants and sets them in the context of their environment. Annotated diagrams and photographs make every task easy to grasp, from how to select and equip a greenhouse to laying paving, putting up fencing or building a pergola, and all the tools, equipment and materials needed for each garden project are covered. Separate chapters show how climate and soil combine to affect your garden, and there is guidance on improving the soil and frost protection, with extended coverage of issues such as water conservation and organic practices.</p><p>RHS Encyclopedia of Gardening draws on the expertise of 50 specialist contributors, under the editorship of Christopher Brickell from the RHS.

Theologians refer to these three steps as Justification, Sanctification, and Glorification. The first and third steps are instantaneous experiences, but the second step (sanctification) is a life long process whereby the Holy Spirit works in the believer&#39;s life to bring about practical holiness and transform his character into the likeness of Christ. It is this second step of salvation with which the believer struggles, because it requires putting to death the deeds of the body (saying &#34;no&#34; to our sin nature), and obeying the promptings of the Holy Spirit (saying &#34;yes&#34; to God) - this is the essence of spiritual warfare. Sadly, most churches in the West today pretty much ignore the issue of Sanctification, and just focus on Justification - either out of ignorance about what Scripture teaches, or out of fear that living a holy life is essentially &#34;legalism.&#34; But living a life of obedience to Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit has nothing to do with legalism - legalists think they &#34;gain favor with God&#34; by being good, but believers obey Christ out of gratitude because they already &#34;have favor with God!&#34; The &#34;key&#34; to sanctified living is gratitude! The Bible emphatically describes God as being both loving and holy, yet western Christianity primarily focuses on God&#39;s love, and says almost nothing at all about His holiness. As such, the central message of most churches is one of love and forgiveness, with scarcely a word being said about holiness and death to sin and self. Satan is thrilled with our one dimensional Christianity, because it essentially leaves believers lukewarm, impotent and ineffectual. This book presents God&#39;s blueprint for spiritual development and portrays the &#34;transformational experiences&#34; every believer goes through in life - they include ups and downs, highs and lows, peaks and valleys, joy and suffering, victory and defeat - these experiences are the &#34;norm&#34; for every believer; none of us get a painless, trouble-free road to glory. Incidentally, the material presented in this book reflects the teachings of the most respected Christian theologians since the reformation - individuals the evangelical community has long recognized as being &#34;pillars of the faith.&#34; To our lamentable regret, however, these teachings no longer have a prominent place in the vast majority of churches in the West. It is time for believers in America today to reconsider the fullness of God&#39;s call upon their lives. Donald W. Ekstrand is a retired pastor, adjunct professor, and author.

No longer a sleeping giant, neither is China a stable ally of the West. Economically it is an emerging powerhouse, and politically it is precariously balanced between the free market and military dictatorship. There could be no better time to try to understand China's history--the distance it has traveled, and where it may be going from here--than today.<br><br><b>The Chinese Century</b> tells the story in over two hundred and fifty rare, eloquent photographs that have been chosen from archives, libraries, and private collections throughout China, Taiwan, and the West. Many of the photographs have never been seen outside China.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a time machine, they let us see historical events that for most of us have existed until now only in words: the lives of the rural peasants and the privileged elite from the time of the Qing dynasty to the People's Republic, the opulence and squalor that the European colonial powers brought to China in their concession areas, the cities within Chinese cities that were inhabited exclusively by Europeans. Here are the rare photos of the Boxer Rebellion and the Rape of Nanking, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. There are quirky moments, as well, such as American soldiers during the Second World War eating their K rations with chopsticks, and private photographs of Mao Zedong covered in river mud after a leisurely swim.<br><br>The photographs are paired with a stunning historical text by one of the West's most respected China scholars, Jonathan D. Spence, writing here for the first time with his wife, Annping Chin. The narrative traces the nation's disintegration into civil and world war, Communist revolution, and its slow reemergence as a military and economic superpower. Focusing on the lives of ordinary Chinese as well as on the towering figures such as Chiang Kai-shek and Meo Zedong, Spence weaves an intricate and fascinating social, political, and military history.</p><p>Jonathan Spence, a distinguished historian of China, and his wife Annping Chin, both teachers at Yale, have compiled an extraordinary collection of rare historic photographs documenting Chinese history through the century. The book has intimate portraits and large crowd shots, scenes of routine daily life and of dramatic events, famous people and anonymous citizens. The story of China in this century is a dramatic one--from waning imperial power through the Nationalist republic to the Communist revolution and the rise of the People&#39;s Republic and its gigantic swings in ideology. The pictures chosen for this collection tell part of that story on a human level, and the authors provide a supplementary text that illuminates the photographic history.Jonathan D.

It was over a hundred generations ago, but the watcher on the hill knew the story. Everyone did. The long column, pounding down the dirt, kicking up the dust, had passed through the canyon below. Then he had built the city in the south and named it after himself. Finally, he and his men had gone, as they all eventually do, as these new ones would. <br>Now the hardpack road below was rutted, studded with rocks, seldom driven. The lead Pajero SUV sent up a cloud of dry sand, which settled back down on the road before the second vehicle came along. They had learned to keep a distance between their vehicles, but not because of the dust clouds. After two hours on the road, the men noticed that the searing sun covered only half of the narrow path. The high, steep walls in the canyon limited full sun to a few hours a day. The two faded Pajeros maneuvered slowly around a boulder where the road turned north. <br>Then they saw the goats. The animals on the canyon floor were spread around a few stunted trees and a small green pool fed by a stream falling from the rocks above. Scattering the baying goats, passing the pond, the drivers accelerated as the road straightened out for almost a hundred meters. Then the lead driver hit the horn, three short bursts, although he knew the watchers had announced their approach. The flaps in the netting against the canyon wall parted as the vehicle drove toward the gray camouflage. Under the cover, with the engines off, it was cooler, darker, quiet. <br>The men in the tent welcomed the new arrivals, kissing them on both cheeks, their bushy beards brushing together. Then they showed the guests to the low table on which the roasted goat lay surrounded by piles of its meat, sliced, spiced, shredded. Bowls held the mezza of lentils and pomegranates. Pitchers held cool water and lemons. Seated on the worn rugs with their rifles behind them, the men began to break off pieces of the flat bread, folding it in their right hands into scoops to pick up the meat. Few of the men spoke. Business could not be discussed before the guests accepted the hospitality. It was tradition. <br>Although the guests were Pakistanis from the big city of Karachi, they were ethnically Pashtuns, as were the Afghan Taliban who now welcomed them. For the Pashtuns, there was no Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The visitors had come, as they often did, to review the reports of poppy production and arrange for shipments. The beautiful red flower grew so easily in Afghanistan and from it came the paste that the men from Pakistan sold throughout the world as heroin. The Afghans and Pakistanis did other business as well. The Pakistani crime cartel, the Qazzanis, helped their Afghan cousins fight the latest invaders and their Afghan stooges, helped in all sorts of ways. The Qazzanis had many friends in Rawalpindi, home of the Pakistan Army, and in Islamabad, where the intelligence agencies had their headquarters. <br>Mohsin Qazzani finished his meal. As deputy to his older brother, Mohsin was the heir apparent to the vast Qazzani crime empire, but he liked getting out of the city, seeing the operations. He felt safe here, off the road, hidden beneath the new camouflage. It was sad that the Afghans had to live like this, but it was better than being in the open where the killing birds could see you. There were so many of the birds now, and they had killed so many, on both sides of the border. His hosts now brought boys with bowls of water to wash the feet of the guests. They lit aromatic wood in small braziers to honor the guests. More tradition. Business would have to wait a bit longer. <br>FRIDAY, JUNE 26 <br>GLOBAL COORDINATION CENTER <br>CREECH AIR FORCE BASE, NEVADA <br>The room five thousand miles to the east was also cool, dark, quiet. Lit by the glow of the screen in front of him, the red-haired Air Force pilot suddenly sat straight up in his specially designed ergonomic chair. He was one of thirty Air Force pilots in the room, each remotely flying a drone somewhere in the world. Each wore an olive-drab one-piece flight suit emblazoned with colorful unit patches and symbols. <br>In front of him were two large and six small screens, ten analog dials, and two sticks. The two large screens provided the live image feeds from two of the cameras onboard his drone, one a high-definition televisionlike video, the other an infrared or synthetic aperture radar image for night operations. One stick directed the aircraft, up and down, right and left. Thumb dials on the side of the stick allowed the pilot to precisely control ailerons and wing flaps. The other stick armed weapons, launched them, and guided them to the target. For weapon release a small, red metal cover on the side of the stick had to be lifted and a button physically depressed before the selected missile launched or the chosen bomb dropped. Despite all of the on-screen controls, a hand had to touch metal before the death from above could be unleashed. <br>Next to the pilot a similar cockpit could be staffed by a noncommissioned officer to assist the pilot when needed on complicated missions, providing a second set of eyes to look at sensors, or perhaps to steer the aircraft while the pilot guided a missile to the target. Today, the second seat was empty. The pilot was on his own. <br>&#x201c;Got somethin&#x2019; here, boss,&#x201d; the pilot called out. <br>Colonel Erik Parsons spun around in his chair above and behind the pilots. Parsons was the squadron commander for the drone pilots at Creech Air Force Base, where there were more Unmanned Aerial Vehicle pilots than at any other of the twelve bases from which Americans directed their worldwide fleet of drones. If pilots were supposed to look like the cartoon hero Steve Canyon, tall and blond, Erik Parsons looked more like a wrestling coach, short, stocky, with closely cropped black hair. <br>Erik got out of his chair and walked purposefully, quickly down the row of pilot cubicles toward the pilot who had called out, Major Bruce Dougherty. <br>&#x201c;Whatchya got there, Carrot Top?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Goats, boss. I got goats. But I don&#x2019;t have goat herders. Water, but no people.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bruce, there is water all over the world without people nearby.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir, but not in these arid mountains in the summer. Besides, that was just the tell. I made a second pass with the synthetic aperture radar imager turned on and&nbsp;&#x2026; presto&nbsp;&#x2026; two SUVs sitting under a camo tarp about a football field up the road from the water. Three more and a couple of pickups under netting farther up the canyon. Now, with the infrared on you can see a whole complex of shit nestled up against the canyon wall, hiding from view under the netting. Or so they thought.&#x201d; <br>Erik Parsons leaned over the pilot for a better look at the screen. &#x201c;Throw it up on the Big Board, Bruce.&#x201d; As a series of green blobs flashed onto the main video screen, covering two hundred square feet on the front wall, Parsons picked up a red handset. &#x201c;Sandy, we got any HVIs likely to be up in grid square A-08? I think I got a live one.&#x201d; <br>In the glass-walled room behind the pilots&#x2019; cubicles, Sandra Vittonelli consulted her own small screen. &#x201c;Maybe. We lost signals from a guy guarding a High Value Individual almost three hours ago in sector A-17. That&#x2019;s not too far away, he could be in A-08 by now. But that&#x2019;s hardly reason enough to get excited.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, Sandy, even without a named target on screen, I am looking at enough suspicious activity here to designate this a signature-based strike. I think we got us a terrorist camp.&#x201d; As Erik Parsons spoke he patted Bruce Dougherty&#x2019;s shoulder. <br>Sandra Vittonelli stood and squinted through the glass at the Big Board in the next room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right out to the floor.&#x201d; <br>Since she was far away from Washington, Sandra wore jeans, but in deference to standards she had learned at Headquarters over the years, she also wore a blue blazer. It helped to make clear the authority relationships. Sexism was officially taboo, but some of these jocks needed reminders sometimes. They were not all used to taking orders from a short, civilian woman in blue jeans. Although she was a CIA employee, as Director of the Joint Global Coordination Center for the program, she owned the pilots. There had been a single, integrated drone program for both the Pentagon and the Agency planes now for three months. When Erik had asked her about the blazer once, she had told him that she wore it because the air-conditioning was set too low in the Center and, moreover, the jacket also gave her lots of pockets for her &#x201c;stuff.&#x201d; Then she had changed the subject to why the pilots felt the need to wear jumpsuits when their airplanes were thousands of miles away. <br>As she stood at Bruce&#x2019;s cubicle, she was aware that all the other pilots were watching her and not focusing on the video feeds from their aircraft. &#x201c;I gotta admit, it does fit a signature,&#x201d; she told Eric and Bruce, &#x201c;but how long you been looking at it?&#x201d; <br>Bruce looked at the digital elapse clock running in his console. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been loitering for seventy-three minutes now. I&#x2019;ve run electro-optical, infrared, and synthetic aperture radar passes. This is one of the new birds with all three types of sensors. The analysis software has located thirty-two human life-forms, identified all of them as adults. Except for seven guys on the hills, all of them are under the camouflage. No signatures of women or kids.&#x201d; <br>She looked at Erik, who shook his head in affirmation. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good one, Sandy.&#x201d; <br>Vittonelli put on her poker face. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s loiter some more. And pull up any imagery of the place from past missions. Somebody must have passed over it before en route to somewhere else.&#x201d; Then she picked up the handset of a red phone. &#x201c;This is the Director, GCC. Let&#x2019;s wake up the boys and girls in DC. I&#x2019;m initiating a Kill Call.&#x201d; <br>SATURDAY, JUNE 27 <br>ABOVE PAKTIKA PROVINCE <br>AFGHANISTAN <br>The mechanical extension of Major Bruce Dougherty, the thing that moved in the air when Bruce&#x2019;s hand made adjustments with the joystick in his cubicle, was pressing ahead at only eighty-five miles per hour against the cold wind two miles above the canyon. Up there the sound of the propeller at the rear of the plane, twenty-seven feet from the nose, might have seemed loud, but there was no space on board for a human, nobody up there to hear the constant buzzing. No one was there to notice that the bottom of its fuselage and its forty-eight-foot-long main wings were a light blue like the sky above it, while the top of the aircraft was a dark gray. There was no one to see the three mechanical eyes of the sensors twisting, adjusting, focusing. The pump quietly kept the fuel flowing steadily to the little engine. The seven onboard computers hummed softly. The blister antenna, inside the bump on the top of the plane, moved silently to keep pointed at the satellite, while sending a steady stream of data up to space and capturing the constant flow coming down. <br>In response to Bruce&#x2019;s slight pressure to the control, the bird now banked, its left wing moving up, causing the aircraft to move to the right, back toward the men below the nets. <br>In the canyon, shadows now covered all of the road and much of the rock wall. Some goats were still in the sun, higher up, near the watcher, hunting for grass and little stubbly shrubs among the rocks. The air had been still, but then the wind shifted and the watcher heard buzzing. His eyes darted back and forth, scanning the bright sky. He saw just the blue, nothing else, the blue. Then the buzzing came again, louder, closer. He unbuckled the radio from his belt and hit the push-to-talk panel. &#x201c;Drone.&#x201d; <br>As he spoke the word, which meant the same thing in Pashtu as it did in English, the watcher on the hill was bowled over by the blast from the first of the four Hellfire missiles hitting the canyon floor below. The missiles hit ten meters apart in a tight pattern, each puncturing camouflage netting and canvas, bursting into orange-yellow balls of flame and then into black plumes of fast climbing, churning, thick smoke. Sections of the rock wall broke off and fell to the canyon floor, kicking up brown clouds of dust. The concussive sound rolled down the canyon, overwhelming and persistent. The goats on the hill tripped and faltered as they ran higher up. Over a mile above them, the blue-tinted drone nosed up and banked right into a tight turn. <br>Another watcher on the road near the big boulder to the south saw the flashes in the distance before he heard the sound. Then it took him almost twenty minutes to climb higher, enough out of the canyon so that the satellite phone could pick up a signal. He knew the call could only last thirty seconds so he thought of what he would say before he hit Call. &#x201c;Mohsin Qazzani.

Reprint.</p><p>Joan Hess, winner of the American Mystery Award, is the author of eleven previous Claire Malloy mysteries, as well as ten novels in the Maggody series. Currently president of the American Crime Writers League, she lives in Arkansas.The latest dispatch from Maggody, Ark., shows the town besieged by militant survivalists who'd be more threatening if their incompetence didn't rival the burlesque follies of the natives. The newcomers include ``General'' Sterling Pitts, the self-styled ``Silver Fox'' who takes time off from his two-bit insurance brokerage to send his overgrown Boy Scouts scurrying over rough terrain; unemployable drifter Reed (``Red Rooster'') Rondly and his more articulate buddy, ``Colonel'' Barry (``Apocalypse'') Kirklin; Dylan Gilbert, an auto mechanic who arrives in town stuffed to the gills with rumors of a double agent who's infiltrated the little band of patriots; and Kayleen Smeltner, the widowed pawnbroker who seems bent on supplying ordnance to every nutcase in town. Since the locals--especially Dahlia Buchanon, whose vast bulk demurely hides her pregnancy, and her husband Kevin, the half-wit scion of Maggody's first family--are just as goofy as Pitts's militia, if less dangerously so, that's a lot of loose cannons, even before a burglary turned murderous, a tactical exercise ditto, a pair of runaway ostriches, and Dahlia's peripatetic confinement put the icing on the cake. Hess's sublimely silly tales (Miracles in Maggody, 1995, etc.) have always trod a fine line between off-speed mystery and regionalist farce. Here, the demented militants, with their minor- key echoes of the natives' craziness, makes an offer you can't refuse. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A runaway cake escapes from a series of pursuers but meets its match in a crafty fox in a red gown who invites him to come closer so she can better hear what he's saying. As adapted from Joseph Jacobs's "Johnny Cake," and translated back into English from the German, this text, although adequate, lacks Jacobs's lively country cadences. The story lines are essentially identical except that two girls replace the ditch-diggers in the original. The most noticeable weakness in text is in the final pages when the cake speaks only twice to the vixen and never gets to the point of screaming into her "deaf" ear, and nothing is mentioned of the fox's broad play at feebleness. Although Esterl's retelling lacks dramatic tension at this point, it does provide a vehicle for the elegant illustrations. The paintings of the vixen in particular have the wit the narrative is missing and make for a satisfying conclusion as she minces off the page with a smug smile. The figures are solidly constructed within well-designed compositions. The medieval costumes and architecture convey a fairy-tale atmosphere and are reminiscent of the art of Gennady Spirin, although not as robust. The roundness of the cake is repeated in circle motifs thoughout--a device that seems a bit forced, but that does achieve a most harmonious design. The placement of white negative spaces within the circular and rectangular frames gives the book a sparkling, graceful look and prevents the earth-toned illustrations from seeming heavy. --Marilyn Iarusso, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Just Behave, Pablo Picasso!</h2><p>"One day the world is a peaceful, lovely landscape painting...

By dramatizing Picasso&#x2019;s development rather than merely recounting it, Winter keeps readers fascinated, and by making Picasso a superhero he bursts right through the canvas of a serene landscape on the second page he dispels any notion of art as tired or irrelevant.&#x201d; -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review<br><br> Using an innovative and offbeat approach, Winter provides glimpses of the energy, enthusiasm, and dedication that ruled the artist&#x2019;s world. In covering his early years (his experimentation with style, perspective, and color were not always appreciated), the author delivers a pungent message to today&#x2019;s young artists: don&#x2019;t be discouraged if your creative efforts are criticized Hawkes matches Winter&#x2019;s storytelling rhythm, supplying vitality and intensity to the spreads with colorful scenes of Paris, people of the time, and fascinating renditions of Picasso&#x2019;s own work.

He tried moving his limbs, opening his eyes, seeking to touch, and failed to discern if his holographic body still existed. None of his programmed senses functioned as he was accustomed, and yet he knew he was <i>someplace</i> because <i>he</i> existed. When he was deactivated aboard <i>Voyager</i>, his sentience simply stopped -- a suspended pause -- until he was reactivated and his lifeline continued. Here and now, he knew only himself, as if the sum total of his existence had been reduced to self-awareness, nothing further. Not even his vast database could provide a reference point. Or had he even retained a connection to his database? He couldn't say for certain. So many of his thoughts were blurry and unfocused. He imagined his current state had much in common with what patients experienced post-anesthesia: aware, but not awake; cognizant of one's body, yet disconnected from it. Whatever force had ripped him from <i>Voyager</i> had sent his holomatrix into a state of shock, though the Doctor didn't know how that was possible. </p><p> Though he couldn't sense his limbs, he mentally directed his arms and legs to move, reaching into the darkness to find the parameters of his environment. The instant the thought left him, an impenetrable barrier, that he sensed but couldn't see, surrounded him. A force pressed right up against the parameters of his program. Drowsily he sought to lift his arm to touch his combadge. "Docplur . . . coo . . . sib . . . gib-blehb -- " he muttered thickly, his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth. The incomprehensible garble emerging from his mouth was beneath one of his abilities. He tried again. When his third attempt proved futile, his determination awoke. The luxury of lolling about like some lazy lush on eternal shore leave wasn't granted to one of such vital importance as himself. He must return to his patients and a crew who desperately needed him. Exerting his will, he pushed against the unseen force that cocooned him in this blackness. The force pushed back, squeezing him into claustrophobic confinement. Dizziness assaulted the Doctor; he would not be deterred, though his body quaked from the effort. The slightest give in the resistant force imbued him with confidence. With persistence, he would free himself, of that he was certain. A nanosecond of warning alerted him to possible danger: a faint, warm sizzle brushed his back. Nothing specific about the sensation worried the Doctor, who routinely passed through forcefields that would cook the innards of a carbon-based life-form on contact. Believing the sizzling sensation to be evidence of progress, he increased his efforts. Clenching his teeth, he thought, <i>One last push</i>. . . . </p><p> Jagged energy threads sizzled and sparked, burrowing thorough his body at lightning speed. His matrix frazzled, splintering him into bits of matter; every particle in his being spun at reckless velocity, unleashing torrents of superheated, subatomic tornadoes, scorching through every millimeter of his form. Out of self-protection, his thoughts instantly retreated into a detached, drifting place. From a separate vantage he processed the searing torment coursing through every photon he was composed of. <i>It is odd</i>, he thought, <i>to have existed as long as I have and not understood pain before</i>. His matrix oscillated with such speed and force that he wondered if he would explode into billions of tiny bits. As reflex took the reins from conscious thought, he twitched uncontrollably, soon jerking with seizure force. A single thought lingered: <i>Save me</i>. </p><p> As instantly as the attack had begun, it ended. The forces coursing through him ceased; cohesion returned. The Doctor's consciousness lurched for a few moments longer until stumbling to a peaceful stop. He recovered quickly from his ordeal; his matrix hummed along as though it had never been disrupted. More importantly, he had been freed from whatever forces had bound him. Sensation returned to his body and he became keenly aware of being sprawled, flat on his back, his vertebrae pressing uncomfortably into a cold, hard surface. He blinked several times but the impenetrable, silent darkness still surrounded him. Clearing his throat, he touched his combadge. "Doctor to sickbay." </p><p> Silence. </p><p> He repeated the action, calling on the ship and half the members of the crew before he accepted, howbeit reluctantly, that he must be out of combadge range. A few of Lieutenant Torres's choicer curse words came to mind, but he believed he was above such impulses. As a thinking being, he would reason his way out. He eliminated being trapped in the Gremadian black hole (no out-of-the-ordinary gravitational pull) and being suspended in a space vacuum from the list of possibilities. He sensed neither motion nor mechanically generated noise, allowing him to rule out a presence on any starship or traveling craft. Methodically, he contemplated every potentiality his mind could conjure until a strangely beautiful sight drew his attention from his ruminations. </p><p> Funnels of glowing specks swirled around him, casting shadows and illuminating, in flashes, rippling velvet black walls. He instinctively knew, as a distant relation, that the specks were individual photons. A steady stream of photons poured from an unseen place above him until a saturation point was reached, and the Doctor felt as though he was encircled by a glittery, golden tube. A transformation began. Sparkling white-yellow flecks danced, touched, and joined together in waves. In turn, waves braided with other waves, forming ribbons that became progressively brighter with each added strand until curtains of light revealed all. At last, the Doctor could see his surroundings. </p><p> The velvety black surface was not a wall, but hanging bloodred curtains; the hard surface beneath him was a floor of joined wooden slats painted matte black. High above, he saw row after row of red, blue, yellow, and white spotlights mounted on metal strips. A canvas backdrop painted with a typical pastoral setting -- grass, trees, blue sky, and sun -- stretched horizontally behind him and up past catwalks and hanging ropes. The ceiling was at least sixty meters away. <i>I'm on a stage</i>, he thought. The realization filled him with pleasure. </p><p> As he became more aware of his surroundings, he heard the faint strains of music playing somewhere beyond the curtains. He listened carefully. <i>String instruments. Repetitious, almost atonal melodies, though the key progressions in that last section are quite sophisticated</i>. Nothing in the style or sound of the piece recalled anything in his vast knowledge of music across the galaxy. He decided to investigate -- in the interest, of course, of augmenting his database. Placing his palms against the floor, he pushed himself up to his knees, then onto his feet. He took a few careful, creaking steps toward the curtains, the music becoming louder by the meter. Recalling his recent encounter with near-dissolution, he surveyed his surroundings to assess the danger and found nothing more troubling than an abandoned backstage area furnished with light panels, props, and cast-off costumes thrown over chair backs and tables. He walked more quickly to the front of the stage, curled his fingers around the edge of the curtain, and pulled it back. </p><p> The magnificent trappings of an ornately decorated theater -- perhaps nineteenth-century European -- filled his view. Upward of two thousand people could sit in this auditorium, resplendent in its gold-leafed railings and red velvet seats. The Doctor's eyes glanced upward -- and that chandelier! <i>Voyager</i>'s bridge could hardly contain it! Flickering candlelight glinted through the teardrop crystals, illuminating the ceiling painted in round-cheeked cherubs and gauzy angels floating among the clouds. He stepped through the curtains into the empty auditorium and for the first time saw the source of the music. </p><p> The orchestra pit was filled with a large string ensemble -- as he had anticipated. What he hadn't anticipated was instruments playing themselves. He watched, fascinated by the bows seesawing over the taut strings, the plink-plink-plink of plucks by unseen hands. The Doctor, who didn't believe in ghosts, failed to understand why a creator with the brilliance to either perfectly automate an instrument or endow it with sentience would set his creations to playing rather obscure, purposeless music with no audience looking on. He was approaching the pit, hoping to study the curious technology, when the stage curtains parted abruptly and were pulled into the wings. The Doctor spun around and saw the pastoral backdrop, illuminated by spotlights calibrated to evoke the sense of dawn. Though the curtains had been drawn by an invisible hand, he was no longer alone onstage. </p><p> When the transformed Assylia emerged from the cocoon in sickbay, awe had filled him. Such beauty had been a flickering candle compared with the blazing sun that he witnessed descending from the stage's rafters. Creatures of light and wings illuminated the muddy gloom, radiating with serene majesty. One by one they emerged from a place beyond, until a dozen became a hundred, then thousands. In the lifetime he'd experienced since he'd been activated, he had come to know the fragility of life, both the steadily weakening flutters as a life was extinguished and the exuberant celebration of a life seized from death's grasp. Neither of those emotional extremes could compare to the rapturous wonderment he felt watching these astonishing creatures. Their wings beat rhythmically, up and down, with the strength of a massive sail catching the wind. The Doctor watched the creatures dashing around the vivid sky-canvas, feeling an unfamiliar longing to be freed from the restraints of his holographic existence, to live with utter abandon. </p><p> Tentative fingers of sunrise cleaved the blue. One by one, golden pink sunbeam spotlights heralded the day.

Full-scale insurrectionary revolt exploded in AD 66, a revolt which took on a revolutionary character as moderate upper-class Jewish leaders were pushed aside and replaced by more radical plebeian elements. The defeat of local Roman forces led to the appointment of Vespasian to command and the invasion of revolutionary Palestine by a huge Roman army in AD 67. The war was characterized by hard guerrilla fighting in the countryside, bitterly fought sieges - culminating in the siege, fall and destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70-1 - and appalling atrocities. Mopping-up operations ended with the spectacular siege of Masada in AD 73. The author synthesizes textual and archaeological evidence to produce an essentially narrative account to these events, but also deals in detail with the historical and cultural context of the revolt.</p><p>The great revolt by the Jews against the occupying Roman power in the first century AD ended in bloody defeat. Drawing on a wide range of historical and archaeological sources, Neil Faulkner provides a blow&#x2013;by&#x2013;blow account of this long and bitter struggle, together with a shrewd analysis of the underlying issues.

In this powerful and heartbreaking account, former FLDS member Brent Jeffs reveals&nbsp;both the terror and the love he experienced growing up on his prophet&#x2019;s compound&#x2014;and the harsh exile existence that so many boys&nbsp;face once they have been expelled by the sect. <br> <br></b>Brent Jeffs is the nephew of Warren Jeffs, the imprisoned leader of the FLDS. The son of a prominent family in the church, Brent could have grown up to have multiple wives of his own and significant power in the 10,000-strong community. But he knew that behind the group&#x2019;s pious public image&#x2014;women in chaste dresses carrying babies on their hips&#x2014;lay a much darker reality. So he walked away, and was the first to file a sexual-abuse lawsuit against his uncle. Now Brent shares his courageous story and that of many other young men who have become &#x201c;lost boys&#x201d; when they leave the FLDS, either by choice or by expulsion.<br><br>Brent experienced firsthand the absolute power that church leaders wield&#x2014;the kind of power that corrupts and perverts those who will do anything to maintain it. Once young men no longer belong to the church, they are cast out into a world for which they are utterly unprepared. More often than not, they succumb to the temptations of alcohol and other drugs. <br><br>Tragically, Brent lost two of his brothers in this struggle, one to suicide, the other to overdose. In this book he shows that lost boys can triumph and that abuse and trauma can be overcome, and he hopes that readers will be inspired to help former FLDS members find their way in the world.</p></p><p><p>BRENT W.

But when you are number ten of twenty, with three &#x201c; sister- mothers&#x201d;&#x2013;two of whom are full- blooded sisters&#x2013;and a grandfather whom thousands of people believe speaks directly to God, it can be hard to figure out what &#x201c;special&#x201d; really means.<br><br>All told, I have roughly sixty- five aunts and uncles on my dad&#x2019;s side and twenty- two on my mom&#x2019;s&#x2013;with probably thousands of cousins. In families as large as mine, even keeping track of your own siblings&#x2013;let<br>alone cousins and aunts and uncles&#x2013;is difficult.<br><br>As a grandson of Rulon Jeffs and nephew of Warren Jeffs, it once seemed that I was destined for high honor in the FLDS. My family had what our church called &#x201c;royal blood.&#x201d; We were direct descendants of our prophet through my father&#x2019;s line. My mother, too, is the child of a prophet, who split from our group in 1978 to lead his own polygamous sect.<br><br>When I was little, my family was favored, in the church&#x2019;s elite. I was assured that there was a place for me in the highest realms of heaven and at least three wives for me right here on earth once I attained the Melchizedek priesthood. I was in a chosen family in a chosen people, visiting sacred land near end times. I would one day become a god, ruling over my own spinning world.<br><br>So why would I ever abandon such status and rank? In the world of the FLDS, things are not always what they seem. The shiny, smiling surfaces often hide a world of rot and pain. And even royal blood and<br>being born male can&#x2019;t protect you from sudden changes in its convoluted power structure.<br><br>Outsiders tend to think our form of polygamy must be a great deal for us men. You get sexual variety without guilt: in fact, you are commanded by God to have multiple partners and the women are expected<br>to go along with it. Indeed, they are supposed to be happy about doing so and obediently serve you. This is the only way for all of you to get to the highest realms of heaven.<br><br>To many men, that sounds like heaven right there, without any need for the afterlife part. They focus on the sex&#x2013;fantasizing about a harem of young, beautiful women, all at their beck and call. They don&#x2019;t think<br>about the responsibility&#x2013;or the balancing act needed to keep all of those women happy, or even just to minimize their complaints. During the one full year I attended public school, the few guys who befriended<br>me rather than ridiculing me were fascinated by it all.<br><br>But while it might seem good in theory, in practice, at least in my experience, it&#x2019;s actually a recipe for misery for everyone involved. In the FLDS anyway, polygamy and its power structure continuously produce a constant, exhausting struggle for attention and resources.<br><br>In families as large as mine, it simply isn&#x2019;t possible for all of the women and children to get their needs met. Just making sure the children are fed, clothed, and physically accounted for is an ongoing challenge. Simply keeping dozens of children physically safe is close to impossible.<br><br>I&#x2019;d estimate that maybe one in five FLDS families has lost a child early in life, frequently from accidents that better supervision could have prevented. And that number doesn&#x2019;t include deaths related to the<br>genetic disorder that runs in our church&#x2013;which handicaps and often kills children very early in life but which many members refuse to see as a result of marriages among closely related families.<br><br>For the father, even though he&#x2019;s at the top of the heap in his own family, he must constantly disappoint, reject, ignore, and/or fail to satisfy at least some wives and kids. There&#x2019;s only so much of his time and<br>attention to go around, and supporting such a large family takes many hours, too. At home, if one person has your ear, someone else doesn&#x2019;t. Yes to one wife is no to the others. And, if a man wants more wives, he will have to engage in his own highly competitive fight for status and influence with the higher- ups in the church.<br><br>Then there&#x2019;s the math problem: half of all children born are boys, of course. For some men to have many wives, others are either going to have to leave, recruit new women into polygamy (a difficult task, unsurprisingly&#x2013;and one rarely attempted by the FLDS), or go unmarried.<br><br>Consequently, being born a boy in the FLDS is not the privileged position it first seems to be. Unless you are willing to kowtow to the leaders and attempt perfect obedience with constantly changing demands<br>and hierarchies, you are likely either to be expelled or to have a hard time getting even one wife, let alone the required three. Just on the numbers alone, you will need a lot of luck to avoid losing everything as<br>you hit manhood. Being born into the right family like I was is a good start&#x2013;however, it may not be enough.<br><br>Once people get over their titillation and harem fantasies, and think through these issues, they start wondering why anyone stays. &#x201c;How can you believe such strange things?&#x201d; they ask. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you leave years earlier?&#x201d; &#x201c;And how could those parents marry their teenage daughters off to old men, abandon their sons, or give up their wives and children at Warren&#x2019;s command?&#x201d;<br><br>The answer is tangled in family loyalties, family history, and a church that has become expert at using these bonds to move beliefs into brainwashing.<br>On my father&#x2019;s side, I come from around six generations of polygamy. My mother&#x2019;s history is similar. Our families have lived polygamy since Joseph Smith first introduced &#x201c;the principle&#x201d; of &#x201c;celestial marriage&#x201d; in 1843&#x2013;and the same is true for most members. One reason we stay is that this is the only life we know. Another is that leaving involves giving up contact with basically every single family member and friend you have&#x2013;sometimes, everyone you know, period.<br><br>And, too, there&#x2019;s the fact that you have been kept ignorant of the way the rest of the world works: you have been indoctrinated nearly every single day of your life to believe that all other peoples are evil, wish to harm you, and are damned by God, unchosen.<br><br>It&#x2019;s weird, but even if you truly don&#x2019;t believe what they have told you, some part of you remains frightened that they may be right and that fear&#x2013;and your fear of losing everyone you love&#x2013;is at the heart of what traps people. Then there&#x2019;s the weight of family history and tradition.<br><br>My great- grandfather, David W. Jeffs, was born in 1873 and baptized in the Mormon Church when polygamy was officially part of the religion. Founder Joseph Smith had begun practicing polygamy before<br>he preached it. The identity of his second wife is disputed because the ceremony took place in secret, without even the knowledge of his first wife, who vigorously opposed the whole idea.<br><br>As Smith&#x2019;s biographer Fawn Brodie wrote, Joseph Smith &#x201c;believed in the good life . . . &#x2018;Man is that he might have joy&#x2019; had been one of his first significant pronouncements in the Book of Mormon.&#x201d;1 The<br>prophet&#x2019;s belief in the rightness of things that gave him joy meant that he couldn&#x2019;t see having more than one wife as sinful. That just didn&#x2019;t make sense to him. Of course, a prophet couldn&#x2019;t have mistresses. And so, &#x201c;celestial marriage&#x201d; was born. It is not known how many wives Joseph Smith had&#x2013;but the number is believed to be around fifty.<br><br>Joseph Smith&#x2019;s revelation on plural wives was grounded in the Old Testament, and in our church it is sometimes called the Law of Sarah, who was Abraham&#x2019;s first wife. The Jewish patriarchs and kings of the Old Testament were polygamous. While the rest of Christianity accepts the New Testament and rejects polygamy, fundamentalist Mormons believe that the Book of Mormon supersedes the New Testament in the way that the New Testament updates the Old.<br><br>Joseph Smith&#x2019;s 1843 revelation on polygamy was personally directed at his resistant first wife. He was tired of hiding his other wives from her and everyone else and wanted it all out in the open. He wrote that God told him, &#x201c;I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith,&#x201d; to &#x201c;receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph&#x201d; and &#x201c;cleave unto my servant Joseph and to none else . . . if she will not abide this commandment she shall be destroyed.&#x201d;2<br><br>Believing this to be a true revelation, Emma complied. Still, she didn&#x2019;t hesitate to expel from her home the women she believed her husband was favoring&#x2013;and, according to some, she once demanded her<br>own &#x201c;spiritual husbands&#x201d; as fair play. Needless to say, a revelation making this practice into gospel was never received by Joseph Smith.<br><br>The rest of the doctrine on plural marriage is written this way: &#x201c;If any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and<br>have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery . . . and if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him.&#x201d;3 Given Emma&#x2019;s strenuous objections, clearly, Joseph Smith had a very flexible definition of consent. Unfortunately, that probably had a great influence on the fundamentalist church.<br><br>And oddly, despite the prohibition against marrying those who &#x201c;have vowed to another man,&#x201d; many of the first Mormon plural wives also had other husbands. Some had left their spouses to join the church and were essentially separated. But others were married first to other Mormon men, then to leaders like Joseph Smith who decided that they wanted those particular women for themselves. Being lower in the<br>church hierarchy, many men accepted this&#x2013;some even saw it as an...</p><h2>Signature Architects of the San Francisco Bay Area</h2><p><p>When talk turns to architects who have made their mark in the San Francisco Bay Area, it often stops after two names-Bernard Maybeck and Julia Morgan. Widely admired, they are the stuff of legend. In a new book on the "signature" styles of Bay Area architecture, author and architecture critic Dave Weinstein takes aim at some of the most important yet lesser-known Bay Area architects-in other words, everyone else. What began as an outgrowth of articles he had written for the San Francisco Chronicle about preserving historic buildings is now a definitive work on the architecture of an area that is unlike any other.

Widely admired, they are the stuff of legend. Maybeck and Morgan did much to create what we call Bay Area architecture. But they didn't do it alone. The fifteen architects profiled in this book were chosen not because they are the best the area has produced, though several are, but because their stories, taken together, provide a solid history of Bay Area residential architecture.</p> <p>But is there such a thing as Bay Area architecture? Many people say no. Historians have been arguing for years about something called the "Bay Tradition" or "Bay Region Style." The term Bay Regional Style was invented in the late 1940s and refers to several things-the idiosyncrasies of Maybeck; the wit of Ernest Coxhead; the influence of farm houses, barns, and adobes; the influence of Mission Revival; and modern homes that soften the International style by building in redwood and admitting regional influences like Maybeck and Morgan or touches of Japan. </p> <p>Dave Weinstein offers a detailed look at the Bay Area's master architects. From Frank Wolfe's idiosyncratic mix of details and foolhardy arrangement of windows, chimneys, rooflines and gables to Jack Hillmer's expressive use of natural woodwork and rigorous geometric designs to Ace Architect's playful style allied with post-modernism that deliberately recalls Bay Tradition architects from years past, this fascinating volume offers a rare glimpse of the talented architects who shaped the area. </p> <p>Dave Weinstein is a long-time Bay Area writer and journalist who has been profiling architects for the San Francisco Chronicle for three years, and writes about modern architects for CA Modern-the Eichler Network magazine and Web site.

If it fails, six star systems and ten Federation colonies are going to fall under the influence of the most nefarious planet in this sector. I can't give you any more details than I have already. All I can say is we're picking up two key witnesses on whom our entire plan depends." </p><p> Interesting words. </p><p> Strange. </p><p> Evasive, yet somehow revealing. </p><p> "Commissioner...you're asking me to use my starship to delay a legal transport in authorized spacelanes." </p><p> "That's right, Captain." </p><p> "So you can arrest two of the passengers?" </p><p> "Arrest is a little harsh. Take them into protective custody is how I'd put it." </p><p> "Very well. If it's so vital, let's go get it done." </p><p> Jean-Luc Picard hadn't bothered to sit down in his ready room just off the ship's bridge. The commissioner followed him out, and Picard felt the other man's eyes all the way. </p><p> His first officer and security chief were waiting on the bridge. They were the only bridge crew who looked at him. The others -- ops, helm, science station, tactical, engineering -- were all fixed on their duties. Lieutenant Commander Data, in his elementally android manner, concentrated on his console and on the dominating main viewscreen at the fore of the bridge, which showed a docile vision of an oncoming ship. </p><p> "Transport on the screen, Captain," William Riker reported. "Roughly ten kilotons, carrying cargo and thirty-two life-forms." </p><p> "Pull them over, Number One." Picard turned then to the security officer. "Mr. Worf, prepare to go aboard and take two persons into custody. We'll be remanding them to Commissioner Toledano." </p><p> The Klingon officer nodded once. "Aye, sir." </p><p> At Picard's side, the commissioner leaned close and murmured, "Must've been hard for you, getting used to having a Klingon on the bridge of a Federation starship." </p><p> Will Riker -- a bit taller than the Klingon though not as brawny -- came down the port ramp, his eyes fixed on the transport as they drew nearer. "Hail them, Mr. Worf." </p><p> "Aye, sir," Worf responded, and played the glossy console before him to open hailing frequencies. Then he spoke into the com receptors. "This is the U.S.S. <i>Enterprise.</i> Stop your engines and prepare to be boarded." </p><p> "Do our -- passengers -- know we're coming?" Picard asked. </p><p> "No," Toledano replied. "It was too risky to tell anyone. There are two people on that ship who have to be isolated and protected. There's no place safer than a starship. Then, we'll rendezvous with another starship, which will take them to an unspecified starbase. Even I don't know the ship or base. Not yet anyway." </p><p> "We're in the vicinity of the Vaughn-Creighton system, aren't we?" </p><p> "Uh, yes." </p><p> "Does this have anything to do with the planet Sindikash?" </p><p> "I can't talk to you about that yet." </p><p> "Yes, you said that." </p><p> "Sir, they are not reducing speed." Commander Data's android face remained typically expressionless. </p><p> "No answer to our hail, sir," Worf added from the upper aft bridge, his bass voice like low thunder. </p><p> Picard deliberately said nothing. There was a certain art to captaincy, and that involved not doing his crewmen's jobs for them. </p><p> "Tractor beams," Riker decided. </p><p> Data looked at his board and worked it. "Tractor beams engaging, sir. Sir...their engines are still not reducing power. There is no response at all. They have not raised shields." </p><p> "Prepare to beam aboard immediately," Picard injected. "We'll shut those engines off ourselves, or they'll overload." </p><p> "Why wouldn't they respond?" Toledano asked as he, Picard, and Worf headed for the turbolift. "Aren't they required to answer you?" </p><p> "Could be any number of problems," Picard said as Worf stepped aside to let him board the lift first. </p><p> Despite not wanting to talk to him "yet," Toledano had already told him a great deal. Two witnesses were involved in a tentacled network of espionage and were willing to speak to the Federation in exchange for sanctuary. Their information probably had something to do with Sindikash, the only habitable planet in the Vaughn-Creighton system, a colony of the Federation inhabited by Earth people from...Asia? No...Bulgaria? Something like that. </p><p> He felt Riker's questioning eyes follow them into the lift. The first officer should know what was going on, and there was a subtle chastisement in that trailing gaze. </p><p> A twinge of resentment boiled up in Picard as the lift doors closed. Not at Riker, but at Toledano. If the Federation had briefed him, told him what was going on, had followed procedure for covert missions, he'd have known whether he was dealing with Romulans or Orions or lizards or insects by now. He'd have reviewed the situation and informed his officers. </p><p> Certainly no information could funnel off the ship without their knowing about it, and those witnesses would've been just as safe. Might it be asking so much for the Federation to trust its captains as much as the captains trusted their officers? </p><p> Instantly in his head he heard the arguments both ways, and pressed his lips rather than voice the thought to Commissioner Toledano, who would eagerly detail the Federation's side. Picard would be obliged to counter with the captains' side, and since he was already hearing it all in his mind, why hear it again in the lift? </p><p> "Mr. Worf, have you notified your security team?" he asked, determined to change his mind's subject. </p><p> "Four guards will meet us in the transporter room, sir," the big Klingon rumbled. "Also, one engineering technician, who will shut down the transport's engines, if they are not shut down already." </p><p> "Very good. Commissioner, I would appreciate some idea of exactly why I'm sending guards to my transporter room." </p><p> Toledano, a middle-aged man who had once been handsome and was now a somewhat silver-haired echo of that, sighed. "Captain, I can't talk to you about this yet." </p><p> "Regardless, I have to be able to give my team some idea of what they're looking for, or they won't be able to do their jobs. They won't be able to protect anybody if they don't know what they're protecting against." </p><p> The commissioner frowned, tried to add that up, and sighed a second time. </p><p> "These two people are witnesses to an event that could tie an interstellar espionage network to a person we haven't been able to implicate," he said. "No one on that transport knows who those two people are. When we get on board, the witnesses will disclose their identities to us, and we'll take them into custody. That's all there is to it, really." </p><p> "Mmm," Picard responded, and thought very little else. He fixed his eyes on the lift doors before them. </p><p> "No one on board this transport knows who the witnesses are?" </p><p> "Except the witnesses themselves," the commissioner said. </p><p> "Of course." </p><p> "They did all this themselves. They contacted us, they arranged transport, they didn't purchase tickets or book passage until the last possible second -- we don't even know what they look like." </p><p> Worf's comm badge beeped then, and he tapped it. "Lieutenant Worf." </p><p> <i>"Security, sir. Transporter Room One is under repair. The molecular stabilizers are off-line."</i> </p><p> "Very well. Divert to Transporter Room Three. Worf out." The Klingon touched the controls. "Diverting to Room Three, sir." </p><p> "Very well," Picard said. Another forty-five seconds in the lift. </p><p> "Hopefully, by the time we reach the transporter room, Mr. Riker will have pulled that transport over and be holding it. We should be able to beam directly on board and isolate your two witnesses straightaway." </p><p> "I'll breathe a sigh of relief then, Captain," the commissioner told him. </p><p> In the transporter room they came upon Worf's four security guards and Ensign Jensen, a new transferee barely out of Starfleet Academy but one who Worf had high hopes for. Since the <i>Enterprise</i> was so far away from central Federation space, the young man had been on two starships, two transports, and four Starfleet supply ships just to get out to the <i>Enterprise.</i> He was twitching with anticipation to actually beam out in the captain's company. </p><p> Picard could tell -- he'd seen the look. And Jensen's eyes never once left him. As if the commissioner's jolly attention weren't altogether plenty. </p><p> "Ready, sir," the transporter officer said as they walked in. "The transport is stabilized. Mr. Data linked into their computer and managed to reduce their engine power by about forty-eight percent so far. He'll keep trying, but the rest'll most likely have to be done on board." </p><p> "I'm ready, sir!" Jensen piped. </p><p> Picard nodded. "Very good, gentlemen. Still no response from the crew?" </p><p> "No response, sir," the transporter officer answered. "But there are some scrambled emissions coming from over there, and Mr. Data thinks it might be an on-board mechanical malfunction. They might be trying to answer. They may be trying to shut down their engines, too." </p><p> "Understood." He turned to Toledano as he accepted a standard issue handphaser from Worf. "Let's take care not to startle them. Mr. Warren, energize as soon as we're in position." </p><p> He motioned the boarding party to the raised transporter platform, where each took a place on one of the clear disks as the transporter officer replied, "Aye, sir." </p><p> "Energizing, sir," Warren informed, and the familiar faint buzzing began. </p><p> In an unnoticeable minute, Picard's surroundings had changed to the chalky walls of the transport's docking bay. That moment of mental fog when the surroundings changed was shunted quickly aside. This place smelled like a slaughterhouse. </p><p> This place was also crushingly silent. Not even the throb of engines anymore. Data must have succeeded in shutting them down by remote. </p><p> But that smell -- </p><p> "All hands, stand by...security alert." The sound of his own voice startled him. </p><p> Jensen moved into the captain's periphery. "Sir, permission to confirm engine shutdown?" </p><p> "Negative. Stand by." </p><p> "Aye...aye, sir." </p><p> Picard stepped across the small loading bay toward the passenger entrance, which was recessed downward about three inches and carpeted. A few paces beyond the step was the door to the seating coach. Worf stepped behind him, without requesting permission. Evidently he wasn't going to allow Picard to open that door without guard cover, and Picard did him the courtesy of not pointing out his defying the stand by order. </p><p> Together they descended the single step onto the carpet. Picard looked down, suddenly feeling as if he'd stepped into a soaked sponge and gone down to the ankle. </p><p> Behind him, someone gasped. </p><p> His foot and Worf's were down into the nap of the carpet, which was indeed soaked through. A ring of glossy liquid cuffed his boot and Worf's. Only now did he realize that the burgundy color had nothing to do with the carpet itself. He had no idea what color it once had been. </p><p> Now it was the color of blood. </p><p> <br> "Oh...God..." Commissioner Toledano's voice quavered with subdued violence. He drew a breath, but couldn't choke out another word. </p><p> His jagged face severe, Worf stepped past Picard to the door. He put his hand on the controls, then turned and motioned his four guards forward onto the gore-soaked carpet. He glanced at Picard. "Captain, if you would please step aside." </p><p> Though he summoned his voice, Picard also found it in the same state as Toledano's, and cut it back before some choked squawk came out. He nodded and stepped to one side, instantly nauseated by the pull of sticky suction on his boot. </p><p> How many life-forms had someone said were here? </p><p> Thirty? </p><p> He had started adding that up in gallons when the door sloshed open. </p><p> Worf went in first. Another security man flanked him, and together they aimed their phasers sharply in two directions. Then the three other guards splashed in, crouched, and took over the aim. </p><p> Leading the way into the coach, Worf's stiff posture wavered in a way that could only be described as shock. The other guards each reacted subtly, but they reacted. A shiver. A drooping phaser. A stumble down to one knee on the soaked carpet. Picard's alarm doubled as he followed them inside. </p><p> The coach was engulfed in the syrupy odor of corruption, blood, slaughter. To his left was the forward part of the cabin, to his right the aft. The rows of seats were all occupied, but with corpses. </p><p> All human or humanoid, he noticed first off, one head, two arms, two legs -- except that the first ten or so rows of seats were occupied by people whose torsos were drenched from the necks down with bodily fluids. Their faces stretched upward, sideward, mouths aghast, eyes tight or wide, all staring in that last moment's frozen horror. </p><p> Under the astounded eyes of his captain, the stunned security men, the frozen commissioner, and poor Engineer Jensen, who still hadn't quite made it through the doorway, Worf took one confirming step toward the nearest couple of rows, then squished his way back to Picard. </p><p> "Sir," he rasped, "their arms...are missing." </p><p> <br> "How many...like that?" </p><p> "Twenty-one, sir. Arms forcibly avulsed at the shoulder. Two of those have had their eyes gouged out. The remaining passengers' throats have been cut." </p><p> Standing near the entry, unable to move, Commissioner Toledano gulped, "What's 'avulsed'?" </p><p> Worf glanced at the commissioner, then at Picard, then the Commissioner again. "Torn off, sir." </p><p> Not cut. Not phasered. Torn. </p><p> Sheer force. </p><p> "The blood splatters on the bulkheads," Worf went on, "suggest the torture was done in this area. Then the victims were dumped back into their seats." </p><p> The lieutenant of the security squad, pale with revulsion, came back from his reconnaissance of the rest of the ship and the cockpit. He swallowed a couple of times. "Sir...captain and copilot are both...the arms are the same. The steward's over there, behind that serving cart. Guess he tried to hide. Didn't help, though. Engine room's pretty bad, too. Both engineers had their throats cut." </p><p> "Some with throats cut," Picard murmured, "some with arms pulled off." </p><p> He squinted at the rows of seats, a hideous procession of gore from fore to aft, and he walked along the rows, now desensitized to the squish of his boots on the blood-soaked carpet. The first two people's facial expressions were relaxed, almost as if they could look up and say, "Hello." Only the indelible stare of their eyes and the paper whiteness of their drained faces gave away their true condition, give or take the tunic of blood each wore. The second, third, fourth row...muscles frozen in perpetual astonishment, brows drawn, teeth bared, eyes wide. And it went that way, all the way to midships. </p><p> "These," Worf said, "saw those in front being killed. Their faces are mottled, as if flushed with panic before being drained by hemorrhage. The murderers started up there and worked their way aft, forcing these people to watch. Then...here," he said, stepping af...</p></p><h2>The Story of Weight Watchers (A Signet Book)</h2><p>The founder of Weight Watchers discusses her life and the establishment and growth of her organization</p><p></p><h2>Fodor's Philadelphia &amp; the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, 16th Edition (Travel Guide)</h2><p>Discover the spirit of Philadelphia<br><br><b>Fodor's choice ratings you can trust.</b> Exceptional restaurants, hotels, and sights selected to help you make the best choices.<br><br><b>Simple pleasures.</b> Embrace the local culture as you sample a juicy cheesesteak, try shoofly pie at an Amish farmers market, or linger over cocktails near Betsy Ross's old stomping ground. <br><br><b>Boundless activities.</b> Find choices for every traveler, from walking tours through historic neighborhoods to fabulous museum-hopping to riverside biking.<br><br><b>Local Experts</b> Fodor's worldwide team of 700 writers reveal their favorite haunts to enrich your travel experience.<br><br><b>Freshest Facts</b> You won't find a more up-to-date guide to the region.

His movies include Plan 9 from Outer Space, Orgy of the Dead, and Necromania.<br>The King of the Really Bad Movies reveals the secrets of his, well, successsomewhat inadvertently. Wood is best known as the writer, director, and producer of such instant trash-can liners as Bride of the Monster, That Sinister Urge, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and the never-to-be-forgotten (or forgiven) Glen or Glenda? (a.k.a. ``I Changed My Sex''). The subject of an affectionate Tim Burton film that bore his name, Wood was nothing if not persistent in his desire to crack the walls of the Hollywood palace. In this previously unpublished effort, he outlines for all would-be actors and actresses the pitfalls that await them when they go west in search of the cinematic El Dorado. And it is truly a worm's-eye view. Wood manages the singular feat of simultaneously depicting the film industry as a kind of hard-earned nirvana and a cesspool of greasy-handed lechers, quick-buck artists, and con men. He does so in a tortured prose that will be familiar to anyone who has seen one of his films, littered with solecisms, bordering on a kind of hysterical incoherence. (``They never error in their delivery of lines. . . .''; ``But the guy had such a dynamic veneer. . . .,'' to offer two choice examples.) If there is a finite supply of exclamation marks in the world, this book will deplete it. As a period piece that includes advice on cheap hotels at which to stay, it has a certain stupid charm.

Russell, Ph.D.,</b> author of <i>Behind Closed Doors in White South Africe </i>and<i> Rape in Marriage,</i> is professor of sociology at Mills College, Oakland, California.An in-depth investigation into the effects of incest was undertaken by Russell to determine the prevalence of sexual assault in America. The Secret Trauma is the result of that study. Some 930 San Franciscans of various races, religions, and ethnic and economic backgrounds were interviewed. The study focused on causative factors; characteristics, such as frequency, duration, severity of abuse, and age of victim and abuser; the socioeconomic history of victims and their families; coping strategies; long-term effects of abuse; the probability of revictimization; incest and relationship of abuser to abused; and the supportive/nonsupportive role of family members. The study's importance is due to its methodological techniques, findings, and review of earlier research. Highly recommended. Frada L.

The story is of a widow who supports her three sons by selling her finely crafted brocades. At the market one day she trades her work for a painting of a lovely palace. Obsessed with the beauty of the scene, she spends three full years copying the painting in a brocade, only to have it snatched away by a wind upon its completion. As she lies grieving, her youngest son, after the two elder ones succumb to greed, searches for the brocade in a quest that leads through fire and ice to a fairy palace on a mountain top. Heyer's 15 illustrations show a masterful artistic technique. From the silken threads of the sumptuous brocade to the tiniest wrinkles in a hand, the photographic realism of a silver necklace, the touchable softness of a fur cuff, the intricate perfection of an Oriental pattern and the fine hairs of a butterfly's wings, each painting offers an experience of sensuous delight. Small red woodcut-like squares featuring animals and birds from the paintings (meant to resemble chops) are placed on each white page of text, adding to the book's attractiveness. Heyer's skillful retelling of the ancient legend and her magnificent illustrations combine to form a book of astonishing beauty.

As well as Laughlin&#x2019;s original essay, Caples includes a new selection of poems from Greenberg&#x2019;s notebooks, along with some of his prose.

Can we see it already at work in our own time? &nbsp; Will the Antichrist be a clerical traitor? A religious leader? A politician? A collective phenomenon?

Its ubiquitous presence has given rise to new terms that redefine the art form and impact not just on art, but also on international fashion shows, movie design, and club culture. The phenomenon of Installation was covered for the first time in the critically acclaimed 1994 book <i>Installation Art</i> by the same authors. This new volume surveys how Installation has evolved, embracing often unexpected media, and its far-reaching influence worldwide. The new "immersive" Installation reflects a desire for sensual pleasure, as the viewer is totally enveloped in a hermetic and narcissistic artwork, as illustrated by the American artist Doug Aitken and the Japanese artist Kazuo Katase, among others. New dynamics have developed between the artist and institutions, and installation is more than ever an open-ended experiment that transforms the museum into a cultural laboratory, as seen in the work of Hans Haacke. Installation refuses to accept fixed boundaries, and practitioners, such as the Mexican Jose Davila, are now looking to forge relationships on a global level, collaborating with specialists in other non-art areas. In a rapidly changing world, time and memory become key concerns, and artists such as Christian Boltanksi and Damien Hirst prefer to construct their own spaces of memory. The culmination of these processes has made the audience itself the key site of the installation as witnessed in the works of Vanessa Beecroft, Gary Hill, Mariko Mori, and Bill Viola. This astonishing process returns us to the body, to the spectator, a space that is both sentient and active, the "Empire of the Senses." Introduced by Jonathan Crary, Professor of Art History, Columbia University, the book is completed by a chronology, details on the works included in the book, further reading, and an index. 318 illustrations, 269 in color .</p><p>Directors of the Museum of Installation in London, <b>Nicolas de Oliveira, Nicola Oxley, and Michael Petry</b> have&#x2014;as critics, teachers, exhibition organizers, and artists&#x2014;pioneered the systematic study of Installation art. Their first book on the subject, called "thrilling," "invaluable," and "spectacular" by the critics, has become the key text for the early history of Installation.The term<i> installation art </i>describes a diverse array of provocative artworks that bring viewers inside an artist's creation rather than allowing them to stand passively before a static image. Artists' installations feature intense sensory experiences that go beyond the visual and incorporate a vast range of materials and media from household objects to mist to chain saws to naked people to state-of-the-art computer imaging and sound technologies. As de Oliveira and his contributors explain in this exciting international survey, an ever-increasing number of contemporary artists are creating environments that resemble everything from a living room to a library, theater, or hospital in order to explore the nature of time and memory, the relationship between body and mind, ecological concerns, the distinction between private and public space, and the implications of the digital explosion. As documented in this worthy volume's 268 colorplates and definitive commentary, the resulting installations vary from stunning to silly, frightening to pleasurable, futuristic to funky, but all are mind expanding and all extend art's capacity for reflecting and influencing our lives. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Ever since Socrates and Plato, the philosophy of the absolute had held&nbsp;sway&#x2014;the emphasis on essence at the expense of concrete appearance, the insistence on a coherent universe, abstract, timeless, finished, enclosed in its totality. James&#x2019;s own thinking led him to renounce monistic idealism and the intellectualization of all &#x201c;truth.&#x201d; <p>Going against the grain of entrenched philosophy, James argues in <i>A Pluralistic Universe</i> that the world is not a uni-verse but a multi-verse. He honors the human experience of manyness and disconnection (and various kinds of unity) in the world of flux and sensation, a world that is discounted scornfully by the monists. &#x201c;Pluralistic empiricism,&#x201d; as James called it, permits intellectual freedom, while the artificial concepts of monism do not. It approaches the only reality that has any meaning, one that follows the pattern of daily experience. <i>A Pluralistic Universe</i>, like <i>Some Problems in Philosophy</i> and <i>Essays in Radical Empiricism</i> (also available as Bison Books), is basic to an understanding of James&#x2019;s thought.</p></p><p>Going against the grain of entrenched philosophy, James argues in A Pluralistic Universe that the world is not a uni-verse but a multi-verse.

It was a life by turns absurd, drab, naively joyous, melancholy and, finally, intolerable. In 1974, when Anya was ten, she and her mother fled to the USA, with no winter coats and no right of return. These days, Anya is the doyenne of high-end food writing. And yet, the flavour of Soviet kolbasa, like Proust&#39;s madeleine, transports her back to that vanished Atlantis known as the USSR . In this sweeping, tragicomic memoir, Anya recreates seven decades of the Soviet experience through cooking and food, and reconstructs a moving family history spanning three generations. Her narrative is embedded in a larger historical epic: Lenin&#39;s bloody grain requisitioning, World War II starvation, Stalin&#39;s table manners, Khrushchev&#39;s kitchen debates, Gorbachev&#39;s disastrous anti-alcohol policies and the ultimate collapse of the USSR. And all of this is bound together by Anya&#39;s sardonic wit, passionate nostalgia and piercing observations. Mastering the Art of Soviet Cooking is a book that stirs the soul as well as the senses.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Anya Von Bremzen</b></p> <p><strong>Q. One of your reasons for writing this book was your feeling of leading a double life as a food writer. Can you explain? </strong></p> <p>A. When I started my career in the early 90s, after emigrating in the 70&#x2019;s, the Soviet drama of putting food on the table was still fresh. Whenever I ate at a fancy restaurant for my work, I felt pangs of guilt about all my family struggling back in Moscow. Over time Russia became a wealthy country, but I continued to be haunted by a sense that behind everything I ate professionally lay another reality: a shadow of our collective Soviet trauma. Something deeper, more existential, and related to food. This haunting, complicated past, bottled inside of me, finally had to come out. </p> <p><strong>Q. What surprised you most, writing the book? </strong></p> <p>A. What I've come to call the &#x201c;poisoned madeleine&#x201d; factor. We lived in a state where every edible morsel was politicized and ideologized. And most of our food was produced by the state my mother had reviled and fled. And yet we experience a powerful bittersweet nostalgia for those &#x201c;poisoned&#x201d; flavors. The complexity and contradiction of this longing is what I explore in the book. Over pages eating becomes almost a metaphor for ingesting ideology&#x2014;and for resisting it.</p> <p><strong>Q. <em>Mastering the Art of Soviet Cooking</em> tells your story, but also the story of three generations of your family. How did you research their experiences?</strong></p> <p>A. My mother has an almost uncanny recall of her emotional life, starting from her earliest childhood&#x2014;back when she was an alienated sensitive kid in the totalitarian frenzies under Stalin. Her feeling of being a &#x201c;dissident-born,&#x201d; always at odds with Soviet society, has been an incredibly powerful trope for this book. My dad, on the other hand, remembers perfectly all the small physical details: what vodka cost in 1959, for example. And my grandparents were great raconteurs. Even after they were long gone their stories lived on. </p> <p><strong>Q. You describe, to sumptuous effect, Russian literature&#x2019;s obsession with food. Who are your favorite Russian authors? </strong></p> <p>A. I love most the satirical strain in Russian literature. As much as I venerate Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, it&#x2019;s Nikolai Gogol, that gluttonous hypochondriac, who&#x2019;s my guy. Gogol is amazing&#x2014;delicious!&#x2014;on food. His <em>Dead Souls</em> essentially chronicles one grifter&#x2019;s journey from dinner to dinner through the vast Russian countryside. </p> <p><strong>Q. You&#x2019;ve spent time in the new Moscow over the last few years. How would you describe contemporary Russian food culture? </strong></p> <p>A. The last chapter of the book is ironically titled &#x201c;Putin&#x2019; on the Ritz.&#x201d; That pretty much sums it up. Foie gras and burrata, sushi flown in from Tokyo&#x2014;it's all there for comrades with serious rubles. And yet, at the same time, there&#x2019;s this astonishing wave of Soviet nostalgia! Even oligarchs are pining for the mayonnaise-laden salads and <em>kotleti</em> (Russian burgers) of our shared, vanished socialist childhoods.</p> <p><strong>Q. How did the work of cooking change over time for Russian women?</strong></p> <p>A. That&#x2019;s an arc I lay out in the book. The pioneering Bolsheviks of the 1920s wanted to liberate women from domestic chores&#x2014;and so both my grandmothers were lousy cooks! But the Bolshevik feminist project failed, and by the next decade, under Stalin, Soviet women got stuck where they remained&#x2014;carrying the infamous &#x201c;double-burden&#x201d; of a job and housework. Still. In a society with so much cultural control, some women of my mother's early 60&#x2019;s generation found personal self-expression in cooking. Now with the avalanche of chichi prepared food at Russian supermarkets, cooking is strictly a matter of choice.</p> <p><strong>Q. What was the first dish you remember learning?</strong></p> <p>A. When I was a kid of five, Mom and I lived on one ruble a day&#x2014;poverty even by Soviet standards. When we completely ran out money Mom would make fried eggs over stale black bread cubes. I watched her make it so many times I could do it blindfolded. And it's still one of my favorite dishes.</p> <p><strong>Q. What is your favorite dish to cook with your mother?</strong></p> <p>A. Each chapter of the book has us obsessing about something different&#x2014;a new &#x201c;project.&#x201d; The sumptuous kulebiaka from the pages of our beloved Chekhov drove us crazy but turned out incredibly. And both Mom and I love the spicy exotic flavors from the ethnic rainbow of former Soviet ethnic republics. <em>Chanakhi</em>, a Georgian lamb stew with tons of herbs (Stalin's favorite dish incidentally) is something we cook a lot. </p>As a child in the Soviet Union, Anya von Bremzen was the granddaughter of the former head of Naval intelligence, and thus a bona fide member of the nomenklatura. She was also the daughter of a disaffected dissident, a child actress and a piano prodigy. Then, because of political repression, she and her mother fled to America and Anya reinvented herself as one of the most accomplished food writers of her generation: the author of five acclaimed cookbooks, the recipient of three James Beard awards, and a contributing editor at Travel + Leisure magazine. She divides her time between New York City and Istanbul.</p><h2>The Scattered Voice: Christians at Odds in the Public Square</h2><p>Skillen leads the reader on a tour of the present landscape of Christianity....

Skillen has achieved something quite rare here. He has presented his own forceful prescription for how Christians may best contribute to public life through a meticulously fair discussion of several other alternatives. This is a book of light for an often heated subject. (Mark Noll, Professor of History, Wheaton College) Skillen provides the scorecard one might need for identifying the players presenting competing &#34;Christian&#34; political options today. He also offers valuable critiques and suggests an alternative worth contemplating. (George M.

He finds both weaknesses and strengths in each position, stressing the need for a nonfragmented Christian approach to politics that deals with the real history of American politics, relates its vision to biblical and Christian tradition, and copes with both the highly differentiated and the global-village aspects of our society.

Dick</h2><p><p><strong>These extraordinary interviews are filled with the wit and aplomb characteristic of Dick's writing, helping make <em>What If Our World Is Their Heaven?</em> not only an engaging read, but a unique and compelling historical document.</strong></p> In the field of science fiction, the work of Philip K Dick is unparalleled. His novel <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> became the classic science-fiction film <em>Blade Runner</em>. His short story, "The Minority Report," was adapted for the screen by Stephen Spielberg and stars Tom Cruise. Dick&#x2019;s appeal and influence has reached the world over, creating the standard for the literary science fiction novel. In November of 1982, six months before the author's death, journalist Gwen Lee recorded the first of several in-depth discussions with Philip K. Dick that continued over the course over the next three months. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the field of science fiction.</p><p>Gwen Lee&nbsp;is a journalist and freelance writer. She lives in Oceanside, California.With his Hugo Award-winning The Man in the High Castle (1962), Philip K. Dick commenced his reign over literary sci-fi, presiding with innovative, philosophical narratives. At 53, the cult figure was verging on Hollywood celebrity with Blade Runner, adapted from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968), but he died in 1982, before the film's release. Sauter, whose introduction describes their friendship, introduced him to Lee, who recorded Dick weeks before his death. After 18 years, these transcripts bring fresh insights notably, into the imaginative biotech plot line of the unwritten The Owl in Daylight. (Lawrence Sutin culled the novel's prospectus from Lee's tapes for his Dick biography, Divine Invasions.) Dick also discusses music, writing, philosophers and his 1974-1975 mystical visions, when the revelation of his son's undiagnosed birth defect "down to anatomical details" saved the child's life. He lived to see 20 minutes of Blade Runner scenes, and responds enthusiastically and extensively to features like the "400-story police building that dominates the landscape" and the punk rock extras ("these are not actors. Nobody looks that sinister. Except the people who are that sinister"). Several misspelled names are a minor annoyance amid the exuberant thought processes ricocheting around this book, deemed in a foreword by SF novelist Tim Powers (The Anubis Gates) a "vivid portrait" of a writer who chose creative intensity over healthy blood pressure, and ultimately "killed himself" through overwork for his art. (Mar. 19) Forecast: Fans will rejoice. Dick's ever-growing reputation will get a big boost from the forthcoming film version of his 1956 story "Minority Report," starring Tom Cruise and directed by Steven Spielberg (filming begins in March). <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ensor</h2><p>It was never a sure thing that James Ensor, the great Belgian painter of macabre and ghoulish scenes, would become a nationally revered figure. James Ensor was unusual in many ways. Apart from his training in Brussels, he spent his entire long life in Ostend, seemingly the opposite of cosmopolitan. Later on he was expelled by the group Les XX for a particularly controversial canvas: &#34;The Entry of Christ into Brussels&#34;, which he had painted in 1889. An expressionist before the term was coined, he used the iconography of masks and skeletons to point up the essential horrors of life, and often underwrote his images with a sardonic gallows humour. It has been said that he appropriated the subject matter of a Bosch or Bruegel and revisioned them using the techniques of Manet or Rubens. But this is to diminish his own unique take on both art and experience. A genuine maverick in the way that so many Belgian artists are (lest we forget Magritte), James Ensor can claim a dark and distinctive place in the art histories of the last hundred years.</p><p></p><h2>Orthodox Christians in America (Religion in American Life)</h2><p>Although there are more than 200 million Orthodox Christians worldwide--4 million of whom live in the United States--their history, beliefs, and practices are unfamiliar to most Americans. This book outlines the evolution of Orthodox Christian dogma, which emerged for the first time in 33 A.D., before shifting its focus to American Orthodoxy, tracing its origins back to the first Greek and Russian immigrants in the 1700s. The narrative follows the momentous events and notable individuals in the history of the Orthodox dioceses in the U.S., including Archbishop Iakovos' march for civil rights alongside Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Orthodox missionaries' active opposition to the mistreatment of native Inuit in Alaska, the quest for Orthodox unity in America, the massive influx of converts since the 1960s, and the often strained relationship between American Orthodox groups and the mother churches on the other side of the Atlantic. Erickson explains the huge impact Orthodox Christianity has had on the history of immigration, and how the religion has changed as a result of the American experience. Lively, engaging, and thoroughly researched, the book unveils an insightful portrait of an ancient faith in a new world.<br> <br> <strong>Religion in American Life</strong> explores the evolution, character, and dynamics of organized religion in America from 1500 to the present day. Written by distinguished religious historians, these books weave together the varying stories that compose the religious fabric of the United States, from Puritanism to alternative religious practices. Primary source material coupled with handsome illustrations and lucid text make these books essential in any exploration of America's diverse nature. Each book includes a chronology, suggestions for further reading, and index.</p><p>John H. Erickson is at St. Vladimir&#39;s Orthodox Theological Seminary.Grade 7 Up-This politically aware account of the development of Eastern Orthodox churches in North America will fascinate those interested in the history of ethnic groups on this continent. While its depth of detail may turn away many readers, the writing is clear and lively. Erickson documents the growth of Orthodoxy in North America from the early Russian missionaries in Alaska through the diverse churches founded by immigrants from central and eastern Europe and the Middle East to the current aftershocks following the end of the Cold War. He describes how the various churches in America have been less and less influenced by Old World politics, but how institutional unity has continued to elude them. While evenhanded for the most part, the author is a strong advocate for unity and cooperation among the various Orthodox churches on all levels. Erickson enlivens the text with descriptions of such incidents as a hostile meeting between Orthodox and Roman Catholic officials and the birth of a pan-Orthodox mission parish, which bridged ethnic and national divisions. The black-and-white photos and reproductions are well chosen and well captioned. The cover art, by a native Alaskan, is particularly striking. A list of Orthodox churches, with membership figures and distribution, is appended. Other books on the subject are either written for much younger audiences, focusing on present-day customs with little sense of history, or at the adult level. A worthy addition for most libraries.<br><i>Jonathan Betz-Zall, Sno-Isle Regional Library System, Edmonds, WA </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Trainspotting: A Screenplay</h2><p>Explores the life of a group of rude boys, junkies, and nutters in Edinburgh, and includes an interview with the author of the novel on which the film was based</p><p>Irvine Welsh&#39;s controversial first novel, set on the heroin-addicted fringe of working-class youth in Edinburgh, is yet another exploration of the dark side of Scottishness. The main character, Mark Renton, is at the center of a clique of nihilistic slacker junkies with no hopes and no possibilities, and only &#34;mind-numbing and spirit-crushing&#34; alternatives in the straight world they despise. This particular slice of humanity has nothing left but the blackest of humor and a sharpness of wit. American readers can use the glossary in the back to translate the slang and dialect--essential, since the dialogue makes the book. This is a bleak vision sung as musical comedy.Trainspotting is the novel that launched the sensational career of Irvine Welsh - an authentic, unrelenting, and strangely exhilarating group portrait of blasted lives in Edinburgh that has the linguistic energy of A Clockwork Orange and the literary impact of Last Exit to Brooklyn. Rents, Sick Boy, Mother Superior, Swanney, Spuds, and Begbie are as unforgettable a clutch of rude boys, junkies, and nutters as readers will ever encounter.</p><h2>Around the Bloc: My Life in Moscow, Beijing, and Havana</h2><p>Desperate to escape South Texas, Stephanie Elizondo Griest dreamed of becoming a foreign correspondent.

She falls in love with an ex-soldier who narrowly avoided radiation cleanup duties at Chernobyl, hangs out with Cuban hip-hop artists, and comes to difficult realizations about the meaning of democracy. <br><br> is the absorbing story of a young journalist driven by a desire to witness the effects of Communism. Along the way, she learns the Russian mathematical equation for buying dinner-party vodka (one bottle per guest, plus an extra), stumbles upon Beijing&#x2019;s underground gay scene, marches with 100,000 mothers demanding Eli�n Gonz�lez&#x2019;s return to Cuba, and gains a new appreciation for the Mexican culture she left behind.</p><p>"Opening <b>Around the Bloc</b> is rather like popping the cork off a champagne bottle. This book fairly brims over with a refreshing zest and sparkle, which, one imagines, is probably an apt description of its author, as well. Stephanie Elizondo Griest, who embarked on her own Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress around the world&#x2019;s greatest former (and current) communist capital cities, has written a delightful account of her curious journey.

His novella Mitko won the 2010 Miami University Press Novella Prize and was a finalist for the Edmund White Award for Debut Fiction and a Lambda Literary Award.What Belongs to You stands naturally alongside the great works of compromised sexual obsession such as Thomas Mann&#39;s Death in Venice ... we are dealing with a writer who deserves his plaudits ... I found myself unable to stop reading ... Headily accomplished ... an essential work of our time Daily Telegraph ***** Worthy of its comparisons to James Baldwin and Alan Hollinghurst as well as Virginia Woolf and W G Sebald ... spellbinding ... a novel of rejection and disgust, displacement and transcendence ... I found myself trembling as I read it Evening Standard A refreshingly slim, subdued and contemplative piece of work ... Greenwell writes in long, consummately nuanced sentences, strung with insights and soaked in melancholy ... What Belongs to You is an uncommonly sensitive, intelligent and poignant novel Sunday Times I had thought of Hollinghurst as I read What Belongs to You, Greenwell&#39;s astonishingly assured debut novel, but questioned whether the parallel came to mind because both writers create vivid, enclosed worlds filled with ambiguous and shifting relationships between gay men. In fact, though, the greater similarity lies in their ability to blend a lyrical prose - the prose of longing, missed connections, grasped pleasures - with an almost uncanny depth of observation ... [The] middle section [is] a masterful study in alienation and escape ... Like the writers he admires, WG Sebald, Thomas Bernhard and Javier Marias, he is drawn to the idea of a body of work that seems as though it is all one book, or, as with Sebald in particular, a territory in which the reader wanders. It is perhaps too soon to say precisely what Greenwell&#39;s own fictional territory will look like - but even this early on, the landscape looks too riveting to miss -- Alex Clark Guardian A rich, important debut, an instant classic to be savored by all lovers of serious fiction because of, not despite, its subject: a gay man&#39;s endeavor to fathom his own heart -- Aaron Hamburger New York Times Book Review Brilliantly self-aware ... Greenwell&#39;s novel impresses for many reasons, not least of which is how perfectly it fulfills its intentions. But it gains a different power from its uneasy atmosphere of psychic instability, of confession and penitence, of difficult forces acknowledged but barely mastered and beyond the conscious control of even this gifted novelist -- James Wood New Yorker With What Belongs to You American literature is richer by one masterpiece. The character Mitko is unforgettable, as all myths are. He reigns at the heart of this book, surrounded by the magic flames of desire -- Edmund White, author of A Boy&#39;s Own Story A powerful novel from a writer who seems destined to produce fine work in the years ahead, describing both the condition of loneliness and the insistent cravings of the flesh with precision and sensitivity. [Greenwell] never seeks to manipulate our emotions, but creates a narrative voice so enigmatic that one feels both affection and disdain for him simultaneously. Too often in fiction it becomes clear how an author wants the reader to feel, but Greenwell&#39;s character is too complex a creation for any easy judgments. And that is what will make both him and this novel particularly memorable -- John Boyne Irish Times In his spare, haunting novel, Garth Greenwell takes a well-known narrative and finds new meaning in it. What Belongs to You is a searching and compassionate meditation on the slipperiness of desire, the impossibility of salvation, and the forces of shame, guilt, and yearning that often accompany love, rendered in language as beautiful and vivid as poetry -- Hanya Yanagihara, author of A Little Life There&#39;s a particular joy in reading Garth Greenwell, in having that feeling, precious and rare: here is the real thing -- Claire Messud, author of The Woman Upstairs In Garth Greenwell&#39;s incandescent first novel, What Belongs to You, an old tale is made new, and made punishing... Mr. Greenwell writes long sentences, pinned at the joints by semicolons, that push forward like confidently searching vines. There&#39;s suppleness and mastery in his voice. He seems to have an inborn ability to cast a spell ... A writer who opens chasms rather than builds substandard bridges ... A subtle observer of human interactions. He underscores the way expressions of love are nearly always, in part, performance -- Dwight Garner New York Times Exquisite ... Stylistically, Greenwell owes more to Sebald than to Nabokov ... One of the great pleasures of his prose is how profoundly thoughtful it is, even when considering physical needs and passions. This is emotion recollected in tranquillity, or rather in melancholy. There is an almost visceral disjuncture between places and actions that are grubby, even squalid, and the delicacy of the lens through which they&#39;re seen. Yet the effect, paradoxically, is one of almost pure emotion -- Damon Galgut The Nation One of the few novels I&#39;ve read which feels like it offers an authentic account of what growing up is like for gay people in western societies ... Greenwell&#39;s novel is at its most affecting when subtly pushing readers to examine their own attitudes and motives ... By illuminating the dividing lines in our unequal world, Greenwell&#39;s novel challenges us to think about privilege, especially our own ... What Belongs To You presents a challenging and refreshing vision of gay life. It&#39;s an original addition to the line of fiction which, from Henry James to Ben Lerner, chronicles the lives of Americans in Europe. Greenwell painstakingly captures desire in all its complex, double-edged intensity ... Erotic holding, emotional withholding and the question of who holds power in a relationship are all examined in a work which gripped me all the way to its sad and beautiful ending Independent on Sunday Garth Greenwell&#39;s first novel is gilded with the kind of praise that debut writers might never dare to imagine for themselves ... none of it is hyperbole. The praise is earned ... first, Greenwell&#39;s abundant gifts: the language, Hanya Yanagihara says on the book sticker, is &#34;as beautiful and vivid as poetry&#34;. To speak in such an approximation, though, might sell it short. Little here is metaphoric though no word is spare. Every utterance seems imbued with thought that is deep and beautiful in its clarity -- Arifa Akbar Independent He imbues his prose with a bewitching combination of ethereal somnolence, luminosity and brutal rumination. His sentences are carefully balanced ... This command of form can also be felt in the larger structures of the novel: in the rhythm and tone of its paragraphs, and in the cumulative music of the book as a whole Times Literary Supplement [A novel] about the lasting damage that a loveless childhood can inflict ... The last sequence includes some marvellous vignettes of loving kindness between parents and children, but they are presented as something that only other people can ever have, and the final pages of the book are memorable for their bleak and desperate sadness -- Neil Bartlett Guardian Heartfelt ... [A] touching, desperately sad story. And the character of Mitko, so vivid yet elusive, explains why What Belongs to You is such a promising debut The Times Contains both psychological depth and moments of breathtaking drama Observer This astonishing debut novel&#39;s portrait of compromised lust holds its own against classics like Lolita Sunday Telegraph My novel of the year was What Belongs to You ... a slender, poised, clear-eyed and devastating account of the depths to which unrequited sexual obsession can lead you Spectator A slender and achingly beautifully novel full of the gloriously messy pain of unrequited and inappropriate love -- Cathy Rentzenbrink Stylist A truly stunning debut ... a masterpiece ... A literary star is born -- Janice Forsyth BBC Radio Scotland The American book changing gay literature Attitude A slim novel, yes, but a slim masterpiece Monocle24 I was blown away by [What Belongs to You] -- Farhana Gani the Reader&#39;s Digest podcast Exquisite ... Risk and desire are the &#39;coterminous&#39; elements of the book&#39;s style as well as its action, terms of engagement Greenwell makes plain from its first page ... Breathtaking ... It&#39;s hard to tell at times whether the narrator is the innocent abroad or an American abroad among innocents. Greenwell&#39;s insight is that the destruction of innocence is a process that never halts -- Christian Lorentzen New York Magazine Outstanding in just about every way a novel could be Los Angeles Times The strength of this slim book is the vibrant, heartbreaking character Mr Greenwell creates in Mitko: object of the unnamed narrator&#39;s desire, fear, obsession and, ultimately, pity... Mr Greenwell offers a tender portrait of the longing for connection and acceptance that inhabits us all The Economist Although this is a debut novel, expectations have been running high. What Belongs to You grew from a lauded novella called Mitko. And Greenwell&#39;s literary criticism in the New Yorker and the Atlantic demonstrates an unusually keen and insightful mind. That promise is fully realized here in the dark magic of these pages ... This is a novel of aggressive introspection, but Greenwell writes with such candor and psychological precision that the effect is oddly propulsive ... In the end, a novel like this can&#39;t offer any resolution except its perfect articulation of despair that anyone with a heart will hear -- Ron Charles The Washington Post Garth Greenwell&#39;s What Belongs to You is the Great Gay Novel for our times ... an astonishing debut New Republic Garth Greenwell starts 2016 on a high note with What Belongs to You, a novel that can be called truly great. The narrative follows an American teacher in Bulgaria and his relationship with a young hustler named Mitko, whom he pays for sex. But the interaction doesn&#39;t end there as you might expect, and neither does the exploration of desire, which Greenwell orchestrates brilliantly. Plumbing the depths of sexuality and psychology, What Belongs to You is lingering and haunting ELLE.com What Belongs To You comes to feel, in the end, like a great enactment of an infatuation, exciting and appalling by turns-a brilliantly observed account of an attempt to make another person entirely yours, to subsume them within your story Guernica At just about two hundred pages, What Belongs to You feels at once expansive and instantaneous, and its lyrical use of time is one of its most striking and immersive elements. In any given section, every moment of the book is present... the novel recalls works like Rachel Cusk&#39;s Outline, Elena Ferrante&#39;s Neapolitan novels, and Teju Cole&#39;s Open City; and, of course, it descends stylistically from Sebald ... What Belongs to You is a haunting, gorgeous, and fierce debut, capturing desire in every sentence - holding the space of what we long for and what can never truly be ours The Rumpus Garth Greenwell&#39;s debut novel What Belongs to You aches with desire and tenderness: an American professor in Bulgaria encounters a male prostitute named Mitko in a public bathroom, beginning a complex sexual relationship between the two that will have enormous ramifications for them both. Lyrical and haunting, What Belongs to You is a rumination on lust, shame, violence, and the ways in which sexual and emotional pain stays with and shapes us Buzzfeed Thomas Mann, Henry James and Marcel Proust are Greenwell&#39;s strongest forebears, with James Baldwin and Alan Hollinghurst as equally discernible inspirations...Garth Greenwell&#39;s writing is alive to the foreign and the unknown; he opens our eyes to worlds we had not realized existed alongside our own. Even the landscape of Bulgaria, one of the poorest and least-known countries in Europe, is made vivid and vibrant...What Belongs to You make visible all the painful and beautiful facets of human life and human love New Republic Reaches, with elegance, with poetry, into what it means to be a human...I rarely feel such a connection with a book: I am sure many others will too, after reading this Bookseller [What Belongs to You is] the first great novel of 2016 ... The book is brilliantly structured ... [and] Greenwell&#39;s ability to parse the complex emotional push-and-pull between the two men is incredible, and rivals books like Hanya Yanagihara&#39;s A Little Life or Ferrante&#39;s Neapolitan novels. His images are spot-on ... And in Mitko, Greenwell has created one of the best characters in recent years. What Belongs to You is a great tragedy, and Greenwell is a great writer. I&#39;ll be reading whatever he writes next.&#34; -- Gabe Habash Publishers Weekly (Staff Pick) This is a project of rare discernment and beauty, and it is not to be missed. A luminous, searing exploration of desire, alienation, and the powerful tattoo of the past Kirkus There&#39;s a gorgeousness to Greenwell&#39;s prose ... This is a heart-breaking, important piece of work, which emphasises to us all how much our lives are made (and unmade) by how our bodies collide (or don&#39;t) with the bodies of others -- Andrew Macmillan Next Review Slim, eloquent and emotionally wrenching, this debut novel is a superb evocation of that curious state known as love ... Greenwell&#39;s shimmering novel recounts an age-old story with such toughness and tenderness as to make it seem new: and that is an art in itself RTE Guide What Belongs To You is a very accomplished novel from an exceptionally skilled writer. It brilliantly deconstructs the expat experience, modern sexual mores, and cross-continental cultural divides, echoing one of Greenwell&#39;s go-to novels growing up, James Baldwin&#39;s Giovanni&#39;s Room. Undoubtedly one of the novels of the year, Greenwell is a writer to watch -- Stephen Boylan GCN Utterly absorbing ... powerful ...

A haunting, beautiful novel -- Rabih Alameddine, author of An Unnecessary Woman What Belongs to You is a beautiful, moving, sensual novel. It announces Garth Greenwell as one of America&#39;s most exciting young writers -- Jonathan Lee, author of High Dive In prose that is at once refined and lavish - the quiet dignity and control of Kazuo Ishiguro&#39;s The Remains of the Day coupled with the agonized passion and sexual tension of Andre Aciman&#39;s Call Me by Your Name - Garth Greenwell takes us deep inside a specific Bulgarian subculture to examine the universal: the disparity between the uninhibited lives we desire and the bearable lives we choose. I began reading What Belongs to You in admiration; I ended in tears. An exquisite debut -- Jamie Quatro, author of I Want to Show You More Garth Greenwell is a unique, and uniquely welcome, voice in American letters.

From the moment she and Mother step off the stagecoach, it's clear that someone doesn't want them there.<br><br>This book includes a richly illustrated "Peak Into The Past" essay.</p><p>The first time I saw a photograph showing a Civil War-era woman during wearing the Reform Dress (often called the Bloomer Dress), I knew I wanted to write a story about it. Imagine women and girls in the 1800s who had to work hard in factories or farm fields--wearing long skirts and petticoats! Not only was it uncomfortable, it was sometimes dangerous as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wearing trousers was a difficult choice, though. For this book, I wanted to create sympathetic, likeable characters who had different opinions. The main character, Emma, is embarrassed when her mother makes <i>her</i> a Reform Dress. After you finish reading, think about how you would have felt if you'd lived in Emma's time. What choices would you have made?<p>Kathleen Ernst is an award-winning and bestselling author, educator, and social historian She has published over thirty novels and two nonfiction books.

It ushered in the modern biography and raised the genre to the level of high literary art. Strachey approached his subjects with scepticism rather than reverence, and his iconoclastic wit and engaging narratives thrilled as well as shocked his contemporaries. Debunking Church, Public School, and Empire, his portraits of Cardinal Manning, Florence Nightingale, Dr. Arnold of Rugby, and General Gordon of Khartoum changed perceptions of the Victorians for a generation.</p><p>The four biographical essays that make up <i>Eminent Victorians</i> created something of a stir when they were first published in the spring of 1918, bringing their author instant fame. In his flamboyant collection, Lytton Strachey chose to stray far from the traditional mode of biography: "Those two fat volumes, with which it is our custom to commemorate the dead--who does not know them, with their ill-digested masses of material, their slipshod style, their tone of tedious panegyric, their lamentable lack of selection, of detachment, of design?" Instead he provided impressionistic but acute (and, some said, skewed) portraits. Rarely does Strachey explore the details of a subject's daily or family life unless they point directly to an issue of character. In short, he pioneered a deeply sardonic and often scathingly funny biographical style. <p> None of Strachey's Victorians emerge unscathed. In his hands, Florence Nightingale is not a gentle archangel descended from heaven to minister sweetly to wounded soldiers, but rather an exacting, dictatorial, and judgmental crusader. Her "pen, in the virulence of its volubility, would rush ... to the denunciation of an incompetent surgeon or the ridicule of a self-sufficient nurse. Her sarcasm searched the ranks of the officials with the deadly and unsparing precision of a machine-gun. Her nicknames were terrible. She respected no one." Dr. Thomas Arnold, the man appointed to revamp the very private British public school system, fares little better: in Strachey's acid ink, he became "the founder of the worship of athletics and the worship of good form." In this same vain, military hero General Gordon is portrayed as a temperamental, irascible hermit, occasionally drunk and often found in the company of young boys--a man who tended to forget and forgo the tenets found in the Bible he kept with him always. And the powerful and popular Cardinal Manning, who came within a hair's breadth of succeeding Pope Pius IX, belonged, Strachey writes, "to that class of eminent ecclesiastics ... who have been distinguished less for saintliness and learning than for practical ability."</p><p> As he offered up indelible sketches of his less-than-fab four, Strachey was intent on critiquing established mores. This effortlessly superior wit knew full well that deep convictions and good deeds often go hand in hand with hypocrisy, arrogance, and egomania. His task was to pique those who pretended they did not. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Never See Them Again</h2><p><b>Seventeen-year-old Christine Paolilla had her whole life ahead of her...that is, until she murdered her best friends.

In the apartment of Oliver&#39;s old professor at Cambridge, there is a painting on the wall, a mysterious depiction of masked revelers at the Venice carnival. On this cold winter&#39;s night, the old professor has decided to reveal the painting&#39;s eerie secret. The dark art of the Venetian scene, instead of imitating life, has the power to entrap it. To stare into the painting is to play dangerously with the unseen demons it hides, and become the victim of its macabre beauty.</p><p><b>Susan Hill</b>&#x2019;s novels and short stories have won the Whitbread Book, Somerset Maugham, and John Llewellyn Rhys Awards and the <i>Yorkshire Post </i>Book of the Year and have been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. The play adapted from her famous ghost novel, <i>The Woman in Black</i>, has been running in the West End since 1989.Hill (<i>The Woman in Black</i>) crafts an old-school spooker in this atmospheric tale of a sinister painting imbued with the vengeful spirit of a former owner. The painting, owned by retired Cambridge don Theo Parmitter, catches the eye of a visiting former student who's intrigued by its depiction of an 18th-century Venetian carnival scene and a figure in the foreground who looks anachronistically modern. The student's questions extract from Theo the strange story of how he won it at auction and the even stranger tale of the bidder he beat: the elderly Lady Hawdon, who claims that the man in the picture is her husband, imprisoned in the painting through the designs of a jilted lover who gave it to them as a wedding present. Hill manipulates the gothic darkness of her story with great dexterity and subtlety, faltering only at its awkwardly executed finish. Regardless, her tale is a commendable exercise in the tradition of the antiquarian ghost story. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She was waking up. Took her long enough.<br><br> He took a drag on his cigarette and blew the smoke into her face. A coughing fit ensued and by the time she&#x2019;d calmed down, her dark eyes were open and staring up at him.<br><br> She was scared. This pleased him. He smiled down at her. They were always scared and this always pleased him.<br><br> He sat back in his chair, watching as she struggled against her bonds. They always did that, too. But they never got free. He tied a very strong knot. It was one of his best talents.<br><br> He waited until she&#x2019;d given up, until her gaze fixed on his face and recognition set in. &#x201c;You,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;From the diner.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Me,&#x201d; he replied agreeably. From the tired old diner on the outskirts of Portland. Getting her home had been a pain in the ass. She took up much more space than he&#x2019;d expected. She was curvier than most of the guests he brought home. It would be a nice change.<br><br> She yanked on her bonds again, a token effort only. Her lips trembled. &#x201c;Where are my clothes?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Burned.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br> He stood up, pulled lazily at his tie, aware that she was following his every move. &#x201c;Because you won&#x2019;t be needing them anymore.&#x201d;<br><br> She shook her head, appropriately agitated. &#x201c;Why are you doing this?&#x201d;<br><br> He unbuttoned his shirt as her eyes flicked all around the room, looking for help. Looking for escape. There would be none. He grabbed her hand from where he&#x2019;d tied it to the headboard and ran his thumb over her left ring finger, following the indentation that was all that remained of her wedding vows.<br><br> &#x201c;Does he know you&#x2019;re gone?&#x201d; he asked softly.<br><br> Her gaze flew to her ring finger and she tried to pull her hand away, but, of course, she couldn&#x2019;t. Slowly she nodded.<br><br> &#x201c;Did he let you go?&#x201d;<br><br> Another nod, but her eyes flickered away. He squeezed her hand hard enough to make her gasp. &#x201c;Do not lie to me, Miriam.&#x201d;<br><br> He was surprised when her eyes flared with a sudden fury. &#x201c;That is not my name,&#x201d; she ground out. &#x201c;My name is Eileen.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The locket says Miriam.&#x201d; He held up the heart-shaped silver charm, letting it dangle between them, watching it gleam as it caught the low light from the bedside lamp. He set it to swing, like a hypnotist&#x2019;s watch. &#x201c;Did you steal it?&#x201d;<br><br> She swallowed hard, momentarily mesmerized by the swinging locket. Then her jaw hardened. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Then, if it&#x2019;s yours, you are Miriam.&#x201d;<br><br> She closed her eyes. &#x201c;No, I am not.&#x201d;<br><br> It was really immaterial at this point, but her little show of temper had intrigued him. &#x201c;Then who is Miriam?&#x201d;<br><br> A tear ran down her cheek. &#x201c;Who I used to be.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ah. So your husband is looking for Miriam. Not Eileen.&#x201d;<br><br> She clamped her lips shut, giving him his answer.<br><br> Good. He hadn&#x2019;t been terribly worried that anyone would be tracking her down. The woman had a solitary, hunted air to her, like she always looked over her shoulder. Like she was hiding. That worked for him.<br><br> He ran his thumb over the locket, feeling the etched lines of the engraved Miriam on the back, then the symbol on the front. &#x201c;An olive tree, two kneeling children, all protected by these beautiful outstretched angel wings.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d winced at the word &#x201c;protected.&#x201d; If it had been a talisman, it was a piss-poor one. It certainly hadn&#x2019;t protected her. &#x201c;What does it mean?&#x201d;<br><br> Again her jaw tightened and she looked away. He gripped her chin and yanked her back. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ignore me,&#x201d; he warned.<br><br> She clenched her eyes shut, so he covered her mouth and pinched her nose closed. &#x201c;Look at me,&#x201d; he growled, all fascination with her gone. He was angry again, which was how it was supposed to be. Her eyes flew open, terrified as she began to struggle to get free. He removed his hand and allowed her to breathe, smiling at her frantic gasps for air.<br><br> He gripped her chin again, much harder this time. &#x201c;Say you&#x2019;re sorry, Miriam.&#x201d; He gave her a hard shake. &#x201c;Say you&#x2019;re sorry.&#x201d;<br><br> Stubbornly she clamped her lips together.<br><br> His lips curved. Excellent. He&#x2019;d make her say it before he was through and he&#x2019;d enjoy every moment of the effort. Because they always said it, sooner or later.<br><br> Usually as they begged him to let them die. <br><br><b> Chapter One<br> Sacramento, California<br> Thursday, February 16, 8:15 p.m.</b><br><br> &#x201c;Daisy?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy Dawson flinched when Trish&#x2019;s finger poked her upper arm. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; she asked, knowing she&#x2019;d been distracted. She returned her attention to her friend, who&#x2019;d stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, a worried expression on her face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. What did you say?&#x201d;<br><br> Trish frowned. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you tonight? You&#x2019;re jumpy. Is it because of Gus? Do I need to call Rosemary?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy rolled her shoulders, trying to relieve the tension in her muscles. It didn&#x2019;t relax her any more than it eliminated the tickle at the back of her neck. Because someone was watching her. Following her.<br><br> Again. Thanks a lot for keeping your word, Dad, she thought bitterly. She&#x2019;d thought they&#x2019;d had an agreement. She&#x2019;d thought he trusted her. She&#x2019;d been wrong. Again. She wanted to scream, to rage. To call him right now and tell him to stay the fuck out of her life.<br><br> A rough, wet tongue licking her fingers had her tamping her temper down. Absently she reached into the pet sling that she wore cross-body and scratched behind Brutus&#x2019;s enormous wing-shaped ears. &#x201c;Shh, girl,&#x201d; she murmured, and the dog immediately settled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m okay. Which wasn&#x2019;t exactly true, not that Brutus would believe her anyway. The little dog knew when she was spiraling, knew when she was on edge, and did what she&#x2019;d been trained to do&#x2014;distracting Daisy before her spiral became a meltdown. Drawing a breath, she smiled tightly for Trish&#x2019;s benefit. &#x201c;No, let Rosemary go home to her family. She&#x2019;s earned it.&#x201d;<br><br> Because tonight had been a hard night for all of them, especially Rosemary.<br><br> Trish&#x2019;s eyes welled with new tears that she didn&#x2019;t try to hide. It was just the two of them and Trish knew she didn&#x2019;t have to pretend around Daisy. &#x201c;Poor Gus.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Keeping one hand on Brutus, Daisy lifted her other hand to Trish&#x2019;s face to wipe away the tears. &#x201c;I guess he just couldn&#x2019;t handle the grief of losing his wife.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe he didn&#x2019;t want to,&#x201d; Trish whispered.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; All Daisy knew was that the man&#x2019;s death from alcohol poisoning had hit Rosemary hard. Seeing their sponsor cry like that as she&#x2019;d told them of Gus&#x2019;s death had left Daisy shaken and feeling helpless. Daisy hated feeling helpless.<br><br> Trish bit at her lip. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d been sober for fifteen years, DD. Fifteen years. He was a sponsor even. He was Rosemary&#x2019;s sponsor. How can we expect to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy cut her off by pressing a finger to Trish&#x2019;s lips. &#x201c;Stop. You cannot compare yourself to Gus or anyone else. He was grieving. His wife died. They&#x2019;d been married for fifty years. You said it yourself&#x2014;maybe he wanted to die. Maybe this was just his way.&#x201d;<br><br> Trish nodded shakily. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d; She straightened her shoulders and took a swipe at each eye with her sleeve. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy gave her a one-armed hug. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m usually right.&#x201d;<br><br> Trish snorted. &#x201c;You wish.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy laughed. &#x201c;If I said we needed hot fudge sundaes with extra nuts, would I be right about that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, but that&#x2019;s a given. We always have sundaes after a meeting.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy linked arms with Trish and they began walking toward the diner where their sundaes awaited. &#x201c;What were you saying before?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh. I wanted to know if you were volunteering this weekend at the pet store.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I am.&#x201d; Daisy smiled up at Trish, who was at least five inches taller. &#x201c;Are you wanting to volunteer or adopt?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Adopt?&#x201d; Trish said it more as a question. &#x201c;I was thinking about a cat. Something to come home to, but not something I&#x2019;d have to walk. Not with my crazy schedule.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s a great idea. So does Brutus, don&#x2019;t you, girl?&#x201d; Brutus popped her head out of the sling that doubled as Daisy&#x2019;s handbag, her tongue out in the cutest way possible. &#x201c;See? She says yes.&#x201d;<br><br> Trish laughed. &#x201c;Of course she does. She&#x2019;s biased, though, coming from the shelter herself. You really lucked out, finding a Chion puppy at a shelter. She is a Chion, right? I looked up Papillon-Chihuahua mixes. That&#x2019;s what the article called them.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Some people call them Papihuahuas,&#x201d; Daisy said. Whatever breed she was called, Brutus was perfect and necessary. &#x201c;My dad found her, actually, while I was in rehab. One of the therapists had a service dog that helped him control his anxiety, which helped him maintain his sobriety. Dad went looking for a dog that could be trained to do the same for me when I got out. She was the runt of the litter, which was why I named her Brutus. She was so tiny that I figured she needed all the help she could get.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I wondered about her name. Although she looks like a Gizmo to me.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy laughed. With her large bat ears, Brutus did look like the little creature from Gremlins. &#x201c;She does. Before the gremlins turned evil, that is. Gizmo was my sister Julie&#x2019;s suggestion when Dad first brought her home.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If I could find a dog this little and this cute, I might rethink a cat, but I couldn&#x2019;t bring a dog to work.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, not where you work now. Which we need to change,&#x201d; Daisy said firmly. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t work in a bar. You&#x2019;re not being fair to yourself, Trish.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;m looking. I&#x2019;ve got applications out everywhere. It&#x2019;s not just having the booze all around me. It&#x2019;s also the drunken, grabby assholes who do not take no for an answer. I really hate them.&#x201d;<br> Daisy frowned at that. &#x201c;Is somebody bothering you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not really. There was a guy today who was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. belligerent. Just wouldn&#x2019;t take no for an answer. I stopped smiling when he &#x2018;accidentally&#x2019; brushed his hand over my ass. Told him that I&#x2019;d have him thrown out. He got mean after that, insulting me. A real tool, you know?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Oh, I know.&#x201d; Because her cohost at the radio station was the same way.<br> Trish frowned. &#x201c;Is Tad bothering you again?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy shrugged. Trish was the only person she&#x2019;d told about the smarmy Tad. &#x201c;Same old, same old. Little digs, meant to throw me off my game. I can handle Tad, for now anyway. If the time comes when I can&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll report him. Did you report this guy who bothered you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I did. I had to. My manager finally did throw him out. The guy kept baiting me, like he wanted me to react. Normally I&#x2019;d just wave that off, but I was on edge to start with. I had a big test this morning and I&#x2019;m not sure how I did.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll help you look at the job listings when I&#x2019;m done at the pet store adoption clinic on Saturday.&#x201d; A new job for Trish didn&#x2019;t need to be permanent, just not at a bar. When she finished dental assistant school, she&#x2019;d be able to get a good job. &#x201c;I checked again at the radio station, but they&#x2019;re not hiring right now.&#x201d;<br><br> Which made Daisy wince, because she knew that she&#x2019;d only been hired because her boss and her father were old friends. It was something that Tad never let her forget. Which was why she hadn&#x2019;t yet reported him. She didn&#x2019;t want to give him any more ammunition against her.<br> &#x201c;I appreciate you asking anyway,&#x201d; Trish said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> A sound behind them had Daisy stopping abruptly once again. It was a shuffle, the scrape of a shoe on concrete. A quick glance over her shoulder showed a familiar-looking man wearing a baseball cap ducking into an alley. Dad&#x2019;s losing his touch. He used to be able to hire people she couldn&#x2019;t see or hear.<br><br> Trish was frowning again. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy lowered her voice to barely a whisper. &#x201c;My dad&#x2019;s having me followed again. I can hear the guy behind us.&#x201d;<br><br> Trish&#x2019;s frown deepened. &#x201c;Again?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Daisy said grimly. &#x201c;He hired a guy to follow me when I was backpacking across Europe last summer. Pissed me off so bad that I came back early and Dad and I had it out. He promised never to do that to me again, but I guess he doesn&#x2019;t trust me after all.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He had you followed?&#x201d; Trish asked, dumbfounded. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He was worried I&#x2019;d fall off the wagon. That&#x2019;s what he said, anyway.&#x201d; Daisy still had her doubts, thinking it was more about her father&#x2019;s inability to break from a lifetime of paranoia. It had killed her sister. It nearly killed me. It had certainly stolen what had remained of her childhood. She wasn&#x2019;t going to allow it to ruin her life, no manner how well-meaning her father&#x2019;s intentions might be.<br><br> Trish made a face. &#x201c;Pretty ironic seeing as the guy is following you from an AA meeting. Do you know who it is?&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Yeah. It&#x2019;s our old ranch hand, Jacob. We grew up together. He&#x2019;s like the brother I never had, but I&#x2019;m still going to kick his ass.&#x201d; Which she&#x2019;d done when she&#x2019;d caught him lurking in the shadows of a Paris alley, much as he was doing now.<br><br> Trish&#x2019;s lips twitched. &#x201c;Can I watch? My cable&#x2019;s been out for two months.&#x201d; She made another face. &#x201c;The cable people apparently like to be paid.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy patted her shoulder in sympathy. Trish barely made a living wage at the bar. &#x201c;Go to the diner and put in our order. I&#x2019;ll meet you there.&#x201d;<br><br> Trish shook her head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if he is your friend. I&#x2019;m not leaving you alone.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine. Jacob is a like a cuddly lamb. A six-foot-two-inch, two-hundred-pound lamb. Seriously, he wouldn&#x2019;t hurt a fly. Go on. I&#x2019;ll meet you there in a few minutes.&#x201d;<br><br> Daisy briefly considered confronting Jacob in the alley, but annoyance had her following the path Trish had taken, then veering off to quickly duck into an alley of her own. Jacob deserved to have the shit scared out of him for following her again. He&#x2019;d promised to let her live her life independently, just as her father had.<br><br> She ground her teeth. Damn them both. She was not a child. I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to be one. She was twenty-five years old, living on her own and doing just fine, all by herself. Well, not by herself, but with the support of people she&#x2019;d chosen for the job.<br><br> She heard Jacob&#x2019;s footsteps seconds before he passed by. Leaping from the alley, she grabbed a handful of his bulky padded jacket and yanked him back. He spun around in surprise, the brim of his baseball cap hiding his face.<br><br> &#x201c;The Giants?&#x201d; she mocked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the best disguise you could manage? You thought I wouldn&#x2019;t notice you because you&#x2019;re wearing a Giants cap?&#x201d; Because he&#x2019;d never be caught dead wearing a Giants anything. They were both Oakland fans.<br><br> She reached up and snatched the cap from his head, realizing only a millisecond later that she&#x2019;d hadn&#x2019;t had to reach up far enough. He was too short.<br><br> Because he wasn&#x2019;t Jacob.<br><br> She took a step back, the gasp stuck in her throat, her pulse instantly going supersonic as the man glared down at her, his dark eyes barely visible behind the nylon stocking covering his face. Distorting his features.<br><br> She turned to run, but it was too late. His arm wrapped around her throat, yanking h...</p><h2>A Woman After God's Own Heart Growth &amp; Study Guide</h2><p>Experience real peace and joy as you follow God in every area of your life--and become a woman after His heart.

By the author of The Color of Water. 175,000 first printing.</p><p>In <i>Miracle at St. Anna</i>, James McBride, author of the bestselling memoir <i>The Color of Water</i>, tells a war story that, like all great tales of conflict, connects the enormous tragedy of war with the intimate stories of individual soldiers. <i>Miracle at St. Anna</i> vividly follows four of the U.S. Army's 92nd Division of all-black buffalo soldiers as they become trapped between forces beyond their control and between worlds. Three of the soldiers have bolted behind enemy lines to rescue their comrade, the colossal, but simple, Private Sam Train. They find themselves stranded between worlds in a remote central Italian village, with the German Army hidden on one side and their racist and largely mismanaged American commanding officers on the other. The strange world of the village floats between myth and reality, where belief in magic coexists with the most horrific acts of war. In the melee that opens the book, the giant Sam Train suddenly comes to believe he can turn invisible, the local miser believes he is cursed with a wealth of rabbits, and each of the other soldiers also exists in a mythical world of his own. But they are all about to be shattered by the Miracle. <p> McBride illuminates an ironic moment in American history, a time when black soldiers fought bravely for the country whose "freedoms" included Jim Crow laws, segregation, and institutional and widespread personal racism. <i>Miracle at St. Anna</i> puts these intimate stories at the center of the much larger story of the struggle of people of color in this country. Each character is trapped and forced to act as nobly and as bravely as he can in the midst of forces beyond not only his control, but beyond his world. <i>--Paul Ford</i></p>James McBride is an award-winning writer and musician. He has been a staff writer for <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>People</i> magazine, and <i>The Boston Globe</i>. His memoir and tribute to his mother, <i>The Color of Water</i>, spent more than two years on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list, was published worldwide, and was the winner of the prestigious Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.

Jane Grigson is at her literate and entertaining best in this fascinating compendium of recipes for forty-six different fruits. Some, like pears, will probably seem homely and familiar until you&#39;ve tried them a la chinoise. Others, such as the carambola, described by the author as looking &#34;like a small banana gone mad,&#34; will no doubt be happy discoveries. You will find new ways to use all manner of fruits, alone or in combination with other foods, including meats, fish, and fowl, in all phases of cooking from appetizers to desserts. And, as always, in her brief introductions Grigson will both educate and amuse you with her pithy comments on the histories and varieties of all the included fruits. All ingredients are given in American as well as metric measures, and this edition includes an extensive glossary, compiled by Judith Hill, which not only translates unfamiliar terminology but also suggests American equivalents for British and Continental varieties where appropriate. Jane Grigson (1928-90) was brought up in the northeast of England, where there is a strong tradition of good eating. In 1968 she began writing cookery articles for the Observer Colour Magazine; the Bison Books edition of Good Things is a collection from this highly successful series. Jane Grigson&#39;s Vegetable Book is also available in a Bison Books edition.

In response, he turned for answers to extremist ideology and was soon utterly radicalized. Before long, he became involved in the reign of terror spread by Mississippi's dreaded White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, described by the FBI as the most violent right-wing terrorist organization in America.</p><p>In 1969, while attempting to bomb the home of a Jewish leader in Meridian, Mississippi, Tom was ambushed by law enforcement and shot multiple times during a high-speed chase. Nearly dead from his wounds, he was arrested and sentenced to thirty years in the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman Farm. Unrepentant, Tom and two other inmates made a daring escape from Parchman yet were tracked down by an FBI SWAT team and apprehended in hail of bullets that killed one of the convicts. Tom spent the next three years alone in a six-foot-by-nine-foot cell. There he began a search for truth that led him to the Bible and a reading of the gospels, resulting in his conversion to Jesus Christ and liberation from the grip of racial hatred and violence.</p><p>Astounded by the change in Tom, many of the very people who worked to put him behind bars began advocating for his release. After serving eight years of a 35-year sentence, Tom left prison. He attended college, moved to Washington, DC, and became copastor of a racially mixed church. He went on to earn a doctorate and became the president of the C. S. Lewis Institute, where he devoted himself to helping others become wholehearted followers of Jesus.</p><p>A dramatic story of radical transformation, <em>Consumed by Hate, Redeemed by Love</em> demonstrates that hope is not lost even in the most tumultuous of times, even those similar to our own.</p><p><strong>"As a kid in Mississippi in the late 1960's, I remember the men of our church discussing the Klan's bombing campaign against the Jews. The men did not disapprove. Later, I would use this fascinating chapter of civil rights history as the backdrop for my novel <em>The Chamber</em>.&nbsp;Now, one of the bombers, Thomas Tarrants, tells the real story in this remarkable memoir. It is riveting, inspiring, at times hard to believe but utterly true, and it gives some measure of hope in these rancorous times." --John Grisham</strong></p><p><strong>"Dramatic...Simply astonishing...Essential reading for these times. If you want to understand how the evil of extremist thought works--and how the gospel of God&#x2019;s grace can overcome it--read this book." --Mark Batterson, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Circle Maker</em>, lead pastor of National Community Church</strong></p><p><strong>"Amazing...Gives hope for what God can do." --Dr. John Perkins, president emeritus, John Perkins Foundation; co-founder emeritus, Christian Community Development Association</strong></p><p><strong>"A riveting narrative." --Russell Moore, president, the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention</strong></p><p><strong>"This gripping and inspiring story is as timely as today&#x2019;s headlines....Put on your seatbelt and prepare to enter into one of the most extraordinary true stories you&#x2019;ll ever encounter!" --Lee Strobel, best-selling author of <em>The Case for Christ</em> and <em>The Case for Grace</em></strong></p><p><strong>"Reveals how easily a political ideology can grow into a radical, extreme, life-taking worldview, all the while masquerading for some supposed form of a 'Christian' faith....A powerful story!" --Eric C. Redmond, associate professor of Bible, Moody Bible Institute, Chicago</strong></p></p><p><p>Thomas A. Tarrants is president emeritus of the C.S. Lewis Institute, where he served from 1998 to 2019. Prior to working at the Institute, he was co-pastor of a multi-racial church, in Washington, DC. He is a member of the Evangelical Theological Society and is an ordained minister in the Evangelical Church Alliance.

Roberts contributed to her book <i>War on the Saints</i>, which was written to counter what she perceived as the excesses of the revival and the deceptions of Satan at work to prevent the true work of God in awakening. <i>War on the Saints</i> is considered a textbook on spiritual warfare by many Christians.

Like William James, to whom he is often compared, he struggles to keep the theories of the human sciences faithful to the fullness and flow of immediate experience. Finally, those who long for contact with monuments of vast learning and strict method have only to look at his path-breaking researches on interpretations of world and man in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, Schleiermacher, and the young Hegel.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Art in its Own Terms: Selected Criticism 1935-1975</h2><p>Published by Zoland Books, 384 Huron Ave., Cambridge, MA 02138.

But if Jesus was fully human (and he was),<em> how did he experience that humanity?</em> How did he learn &nbsp;(and as a human he had to learn) that he was the Messiah? What experiences did he have as a child and as a young man? Did he ever doubt? How did he experience shame, guilt, temptation, anger, and love? How could he endure the cross?<br> <br> These questions and many others are answered in this provocative but plausible &#x201c;interview&#x201d; with Jesus. Using clues provided by Old Testament messianic prophecies and the New Testament Gospels, Hodges presents an emotionally powerful and theologically orthodox re-creation of Jesus&#x2019; life from birth to resurrection. </p> <p>&#x201c;Dr. Hodges has employed a sanctified imagination, rooted in the Gospels, to create a profile of the Word-made-flesh that is wholly reasonable, wholly honoring to the precious doctrine of the Incarnation.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;D.

Roosevelt is chronicled exquisitely in this Jazz Age political drama spiced with illegal gambling, speakeasies, actress mistresses, and dangerous criminals.</p><p>In the latter half of the Jazz Age 1920s, New York City's flamboyant "Night Mayor," Jimmy Walker, was often more likely to be found checking out Manhattan's numerous speakeasies than at his office. His luck ran out in 1932, however, when an investigation into citywide corruption led by former state judge Samuel Seabury set its sights on City Hall, and the governor--fellow Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who also happened to be in the midst of his first presidential campaign--became personally involved in the proceedings. By the end of the year, Walker had resigned and FDR was on his way to the White House.<p> <i>Once upon a Time in New York</i> is a lively account of how Walker's downfall came to play such a crucial role in Roosevelt's ascendancy. Herbert Mitgang lays out the complexities of New York City politics, still at that time deeply influenced by Tammany Hall, with admirable clarity, and the facts are so intriguing that he doesn't have to embellish them to heighten the reader's interest. On the other hand, the book is overloaded with period-setting data points. While it's helpful to know that Walker was a Yankees fan, Mitgang probably didn't need to include the batting averages of eight-ninths of the team's starting lineup in 1927. (And, while the song "Little Tin Box" from the Broadway musical <i>Fiorello!</i> is, in fact, a very humorous rendition of the Seabury hearings, it wasn't written until nearly 30 years had passed.) Still, with such a great setting, and such colorful characters, it's hard to go too far wrong. <i>Once upon a Time in New York</i> ends up being as fun to read as it is substantial.</p><b>Herbert Mitgang</b> covered national, international, and New York cultural subjects as editorial writer and correspondent for <i>The New York Times.</i> He is author or editor of fifteen books in American history, law, literature, reportage, and fiction; and he has served as president of both the Authors Guild and the Authors League Fund.

Eventually, she must face the fear that her powers provoke in other people. Sephie's responsibilities continue to grow, and she is moving away from being part of Meridian to claiming a position in Demetria. The vivid art is one of the strong points of the book.

In this monumental work, David Shipler delves into the origins of the prejudices that have been intensified by war, terrorism, and nationalism. <p> Focusing on the diverse cultures that exist side by side in Israel and Israeli-controlled territories, Shipler examines the process of indoctrination that begins in schools; he discusses the far-ranging effects of socioeconomic differences, historical conflicts between Islam and Judaism, attitudes about the Holocaust, and much more. And he writes of the people: the Arab woman in love with a Jew, the retired Israeli military officer, the Palestinian guerilla, the handsome actor whose father is Arab and whose mother is Jewish. </p></p><p>The correspondent for The New York Times in Jerusalem from 1979 to 1984, David K. Shipler brings a very American moral commitment to the problem of Arab-Jewish relations. The occupation of the West Bank was by then a static fact of life; many young Israelis and Palestinians had grown up knowing no other reality. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the massacres of Palestinians by Lebanese militiamen at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, which were under Israeli control, had shaken the consciences of many American Jews. Many of the voices in this book are American, from idealistic young secular Jews working for Arab-Jewish cooperation to the more fanatical followers of Meir Kahane. This work, which won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction, gives Shipler&#39;s narrative the power of a terrible family argument.Rhidian Brook was born in Tenby, South Wales. <b>The Testimony of Taliesin Jones</b> received the Somerset Maugham and Betty Task Awards and was short-listed for the Welsh Novel of the Year.

A Strong West Wind begins in the 1950s in the wilds of the Texas Panhandle&#x2013;a place of both boredom and beauty, its flat horizons broken only by oil derricks, grain elevators, and church steeples. Its story belongs to a girl who grew up surrounded by dust storms and cattle ranches and summer lightning, who took refuge from the vastness of the land and the ever-present wind by retreating into books. What she found there, from renegade women to men who lit out for the territory, turned out to offer a blueprint for her own future. Caldwell would grow up to become a writer, but first she would have to fall in love with a man who was every mother&#x2019;s nightmare, live through the anguish and fire of the Vietnam years, and defy the father she adored, who had served as a master sergeant in the Second World War. <br>A Strong West Wind is a memoir of culture and history&#x2013;of fathers and daughters, of two world wars and the passionate rebellions of the sixties. But it is also about the mythology of place and the evolution of a sensibility: about how literature can shape and even anticipate a life.<br>Caldwell possesses the extraordinary ability to illuminate the desires, stories, and lives of ordinary people. Written with humanity, urgency, and beautiful restraint, A Strong West Wind is a magical and unforgettable book, destined to become an American classic.</p><p>Gail Caldwell is the chief book critic for The Boston Globe, where she has been a staff writer and critic since 1985. In 2001, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Criticism. She is also an avid rower. Caldwell lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Poised at the heart of so much open land, Amarillo, too,<br>sprawled in a sort of languid disregard, as though territorial hegemony<br>might make up for all that loneliness. Route 66 cut through<br>the center of town as a streamlined reminder of what was out<br>there to the west, and the trucks roared through town day and<br>night, slaves to hope and white-line fever, heading for California<br>or just somewhere else. The steak houses and truck stops at<br>either end of the city confirmed these great distances, offering<br>twenty-four-ounce T-bones along with the diesel fuel, and the<br>neon from the all-night signs must have looked from the sky like<br>paths of light&#x2014;bright flashes of pink and green and white as the<br>town grew sparser, flanked on the highway to the east and west<br>alike by miles of open country.<br><br>Downtown in the 1950s was only a few blocks long, and the<br>two banks, the two movie theaters, the Silver Grill Cafeteria, and<br>the Amarillo Grain Exchange were all within shooting distance of<br>one another. The Mary E. Bivins Memorial Library stood on the<br>outskirts of these necessities, on Tenth and Polk, a generous old<br>Georgian mansion with two sets of stone steps up to its wide verandas.<br>The place had been built as a private home at the turn of<br>the century, and its interiors still held traces of domestic calm&#x2014;<br>the foyer smelled wonderfully of floor wax and printer&#x2019;s ink and<br>no doubt years&#x2019; worth of muted librarians&#x2019; cologne. The books<br>were spread luxuriantly over four floors, with the aisles between<br>shelves feeling as wide as city streets. It was here that an entire<br>generation of kids enjoyed a certain benign neglect in the scorching<br>Texas summers: Scores of mothers deposited their children<br>at the library each day to snatch a few hours of freedom in between<br>the swimming pool and the grocery store. The place was<br>safe, it was cool (in the days before air-conditioning,we had only<br>swamp coolers), and, with its gruff librarians posted like marines<br>between Adult Fiction and the checkout desk, it offered a semblance<br>of day-care-cum-self-improvement. In a city five hundred<br>miles from the Texas Gulf Coast and a day&#x2019;s car ride from the<br>mountains of neighboring New Mexico, the town pools and the<br>library were the closest thing a lot of people had to getting away.<br>Our idea of escape was an order of fries at the snack bar of<br>the Western Riviera&#x2014;a cross-shaped turquoise swimming pool<br>slapped across the prairie like an SOS sign to God&#x2014;and then the<br>insouciant promise of the library, where you could lose yourself<br>for hours in sanctioned daydreams.<br><br>Maybe such repositories of childhood are always graced by<br>memory, each of them archives of that wider world to come. But<br>for me those rooms were my Elysian fields, possessing a grandeur<br>and reach that would blur over time but scarcely diminish after I<br>had taken flight. My mother drove us to the library in an old Ford<br>station wagon, two-tone Palomino Pink, and I can see it still,<br>idling on the street below, as I half staggered down the stone steps<br>with my weekly haul. There was a limit to the number of books,<br>probably ten or twelve, that children were allowed, and the librarian<br>at first admonished me that my appetites were likely to<br>prove grander than my capabilities. But I was bored beyond measure<br>without a book in my hand, and each week I surprised her<br>by showing up for more.<br><br>This doggedness had revealed itself early on, an adaptive trait<br>for a would-be toddler who had struggled to walk until well past<br>the age of two. By the time I finally got to my feet, I stayed there&#x2014;<br>a victory that must have assured me, on some profound and preverbal<br>level, that determination was a mighty ally. Certainly it<br>proved useful in the library&#x2019;s summer reading contests, where,<br>one sweltering July, our literary progress was tracked by tiny flags<br>ascending a papier-m�ch� mountain. Each Friday the young explorers<br>would report to base camp to summarize the books we<br>had finished; once the librarian had determined we were telling<br>the truth, she would move our flags closer to the summit. I remember<br>this textual expedition with pain and pleasure both: the<br>giddy journey into higher altitudes, as I left the pack behind, the<br>weekly anticipation of receiving our sentry&#x2019;s seal of approval.<br>And finally, the misery of coming in second to a boy in my age<br>group&#x2014;I was probably nine&#x2014;who had dared to outread me.<br>The realms of athletics and other hand-eye endeavors had<br>found me thus far undistinguished. When she was five,my sister<br>had drawn a horse of such promise that the picture won a local<br>contest; I promptly got out the tracing paper and copied her masterpiece,<br>an act that suggested the visual pursuits be left to her.<br><br>What I possessed was a capacity to absorb and retain great quantities<br>of words, a skill useful in spelling bees, Latin conjugations,<br>and, for one shining moment, onstage. My dramatic talents were<br>confined mostly to a deep second alto, but I snared the lead in the<br>sixth-grade school play simply because no other child could<br>memorize the lines. Dressed in a red, white, and blue flowing<br>gown that my mother had painstakingly sewn, I was cast as the<br>small embodiment of the American flag. Like a one-girl chorus in<br>a Greek drama,my role was to deliver great swatches of truth and<br>beauty from a pedestal on high. &#x201c;I am the American flag!&#x201d; began<br>my soliloquy, then marched on through the ages to the rockets&#x2019;<br>red glare.<br><br>Such fervor must have met with a forgiving crowd in those<br>Cold War and Camelot years. With the native-son exception of<br>Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1964, Amarillo would vote overwhelmingly<br>Republican in every presidential election for the last<br>half of the twentieth century&#x2014;a conservatism that displayed its<br>colors everywhere from Sunday-morning sermons (where might<br>was always right) to young girls camouflaged as American flags.<br>My father had been a master sergeant in the Eighth Air Force<br>during the Second World War, stationed for three years in a<br>supply-command base in Blackpool, England, until months after<br>the European theater was over. A tall, brown-haired man with<br>pool-dark eyes and a slow, trustworthy grin, he had the type of<br>young-Jimmy-Stewart physical stature that Hollywood had lionized<br>in its soldier-heroes. I was born five years after his return, in<br>1951, and I grew up cloaked in the sweet mysteries of his having<br><br>belonged to such an exotic mission. This aura of intrigue was<br>heightened by the stories he told and the ones he wouldn&#x2019;t: the<br>poker games he&#x2019;d played and won throughout the war, the scar<br>on his chest he refused to explain but that I imagined was a knife<br>wound. Mostly, though, I had a notion of my father as a soldier in<br>charge of a company of men, where his physical strength and<br>bluster-rough camaraderie must have been on full display. For a<br>child, these heroic images were part of a larger dimension that included<br>physical warmth and the smell of coffee and Camel cigarettes;<br>taken together, they offered a portrait of a dad who was<br>already larger than life. When I stood on that stage in my patriotic<br>garb, delivering my lines to a full house, I knew the audience held<br>a man who had come back from the war to take care of me. I must<br>have believed myself at the very center of the home of the brave.<br>The war novels were housed in the basement of the library,<br>within the larger territory of Adult Fiction, where I wasn&#x2019;t supposed<br>to be. So this was where I headed, preferring the remote<br>aisles of the last rows of the alphabet, where I was less likely to be<br>apprehended. There was a vague warning, issued by mothers<br>and librarians both, to be on the lookout for strange, nonreading<br>men&#x2014;the ones who smelled of whiskey, nodded off at the reading<br>tables, or seemed too interested in children. I was far too young<br>to consider that most of these dispossessed were veterans of their<br>own wars, real or illusory, and were, like me, simply looking for<br>shelter. They never bothered me and I hardly noticed them, for I<br>was curled up on the lineoleum before the rows of Leon Uris and<br>Herman Wouk&#x2014;men whom I followed, without anyone&#x2019;s permission,<br>into battlefields and drop zones of untold danger and intrigue.<br>Did other girls love war novels the way I did, in those years<br>when the national mythos was still dizzy with the aura of Allied<br>victory? I know only that my passion for the genre was probably<br>the beginning of a tragic worldview&#x2014;that Uris&#x2019;s <i>Battle Cry </i>and<br><i>Mila 18 </i>would send me on to the grittier likes of James Jones and<br>Norman Mailer; that the moral ambiguities of Wouk&#x2019;s <i>The Caine<br>Mutiny </i>may have prepared me for Dostoyevsky in adolescence. If<br><i>The Yearling </i>had been my first literary instruction in grief&#x2014;in the<br>unalloyed pain of love and separation&#x2014;then the messy heroics of<br>fallen soldiers only secured that terrible lesson: the idea that<br>valor could face off with evil in a field of mud, and lose.<br>That&#x2019;s grim fare for a child, no doubt sweetened by the pulpy<br>promise of Uris and Wouk; like most Americans, as William<br>Dean Howells noted, I still preferred my tragedies with happy<br>endings. And not for me the local wars of either Texas or the<br>Deep South. I was bored by literary accounts of the Alamo and<br>the Civil War, though this distinction, in which I eschewed<br>provincial battles for the European fronts of modern war, had<br>more to do with my father than with any sense of regional shame<br>or estrangement. Because he had returned unscathed from &#x201c;his&#x201d;<br>war&#x2014;which had, astonishingly, managed to take place before I<br>existed&#x2014;I needed to know everything about it.

Throughout the book Kim Nielsen illustrates how concepts of disability have deeply shaped the American experience from deciding who was allowed to immigrate to establishing labor laws and justifying slavery and gender discrimination. The book abounds with compelling stories pulled from primary documents and social histories to retell American history through the eyes, words, and impressions of the people who lived it.

Was I wrong!<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;ve learned that disability pushes us to examine ourselves and the difficult questions about the American past. Which peoples and which bodies have been considered fit and appropriate for public life and active citizenship? How have people with disabilities forged their own lives, their own communities, and shaped the United States? How &nbsp;has disability &nbsp;affected &nbsp;law,&nbsp; policy, economics, &nbsp;play, &nbsp;national &nbsp;identity, &nbsp;and &nbsp;daily &nbsp;life? The answers to these questions reveal a tremendous amount about us as a nation.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>A Disability &nbsp;History &nbsp;of the United &nbsp;States </i>places the experiences of people &nbsp;with disabilities &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;center &nbsp;of the &nbsp;American story. In many ways, this is a familiar telling. In other ways, how- ever, it is a radical repositioning of US history. &nbsp;As such, it casts new light on familiar stories (such as slavery and immigration), while also telling new stories (such as the ties between nativism and oralism in the late nineteenth century). &nbsp;It also makes clear that there has been no singular disability experience. Although people with disabilities share social stigmatization, and some- times are brought together by common experiences and common goals, their lives and interests have varied widely according to race, class, sexuality, gender, age, ideology, region, and type of disability&#x2014;physical, cognitive, sensory, and/or psychological.<br><br>While telling the history of people with disabilities, <i>A Disability History of the United States </i>will also tell the history of the concept of disability. &nbsp;These are two very different tasks. &nbsp;Throughout US history, disability has been used symbolically and metaphorically in venues as diverse as popular culture (freak shows, for example) and language (&#x201c;That&#x2019;s so lame&#x201d;; &#x201c;What a retard&#x201d;; &#x201c;special&#x201d;). <br><br>When&#x201c;disability&#x201d; is considered to be synonymous with &#x201c;deficiency&#x201d; and &#x201c;dependency,&#x201d; it contrasts sharply with American ideals of independence and autonomy. Thus, disability has served as an effective weapon in contests over power and ideology. For example, at varying times, African Americans, immigrants, gays and lesbians, poor people, and women have been defined categorically as defective citizens incapable of full civic participation.<br><br>The &nbsp;story &nbsp;of US history &nbsp;is often &nbsp;told &nbsp;as a story &nbsp;of independence, rugged individualism,&nbsp; autonomy, and self-made men (and occasionally &nbsp;women) &nbsp;who, through &nbsp;hard &nbsp;work and determination, move from &nbsp;rags to riches. Just as the colonists sought &nbsp;and gained independence &nbsp;from Great&nbsp; Britain in order&nbsp; to create a successful &nbsp;and powerful &nbsp;country, &nbsp;so must &nbsp;individual &nbsp;citizens &nbsp;seek and gain independence in order to create successful and powerful selves. The idealized notion holds that we are a nation of Horatio Algers, perpetual train engines chugging our way (<i>I think I can, I think I can</i>) up to the city on the hill, insisting that we can do it ourselves. &nbsp;And, of course, the US democracy is founded on the premise that citizens <i>are </i>capable. &nbsp;It is the responsibility and privilege of citizens to vote, contribute economically, and have a say in their government. As citizens, &nbsp;as good citizens, &nbsp;we are to&nbsp; &#x201c;stand &nbsp;on&nbsp; our &nbsp;own &nbsp;two &nbsp;feet&#x201d; &nbsp;and &#x201c;speak &nbsp;up for ourselves&#x201d; (ableist phrases, if ever there were). In this version of the national story, independence is good and dependency is bad. Dependency means inequality, weakness, and reliance on others.<br><br>When disability is equated with dependency, disability is stigmatized. &nbsp;Citizens with disabilities are labeled inferior citizens. When&nbsp; disability &nbsp;is understood &nbsp;as dependency, &nbsp;disability &nbsp;is posited &nbsp;in direct &nbsp;contrast &nbsp;to &nbsp;American &nbsp;ideals &nbsp;of independence and autonomy.<br><br>In real life, however, just as in a real democracy, all of us are dependent on others. All of us contribute &nbsp;to and benefit from the care of others&#x2014;as &nbsp;taxpayers, &nbsp;as recipients of public education, as the children &nbsp;of parents, &nbsp;as those who use public roads &nbsp;or transportation, as beneficiaries &nbsp;of publicly funded medical &nbsp;research, as those who do not participate in wage work during varying life stages, and on and on. We are an interdependent people. As historian Linda Kerber wrote, critiquing the gendered nature of the American ideal of individualism, &#x201c;The myth of the lone individual is a trope, a rhetorical device. In real life no one is self-made; few are truly alone.&#x201d; Dependency&nbsp;is not bad&#x2014;indeed, it is at the heart of both the human and the American experience. It is what makes a community and a democracy.<br><br>The &nbsp;use of disability &nbsp;as an &nbsp;analytic &nbsp;tool &nbsp;matters &nbsp;in our &nbsp;national &nbsp;story &nbsp;because &nbsp;it forces&nbsp; consideration &nbsp;of the &nbsp;strengths, weaknesses, and contradictions of American ideals. Taking note of race, class, and gender, scholars have examined the historical expansion of democracy. &nbsp;It is time to do the same for disability. Additionally, a richer understanding of US history demands that we use disability to better understand the interdependent nature of democratic communities.<br><br>Disability is not the story of someone else. It is <i>our </i>story, the story of someone we love, the story of who we are or may become, and it is undoubtedly the story of our nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, quite simply, the American story in all of its complexities. &nbsp;The story of US history is one of many efforts to define, contest, and enshrine a specific national body as best for the nation&#x2014;a national body both individual and collective.<br><br>But . . . what is disability? &nbsp;Who are people with disabilities? And conversely, what does it mean to be nondisabled? &nbsp;When the US Supreme Court struggled to define obscenity in 1964, Justice Potter Stewart threw up his hands in frustration and wrote, &#x201c;I know it when I see it.&#x201d;2 It&#x2019;s&nbsp;temptingly easy to do the same about disability. We generally assume that disability is a clearly defined category, unchanging and concrete. &nbsp;Closer inspection, however, reveals that disability is often elusive and changing. &nbsp;Not only do people with disabilities have a history, but the concept of disability has a history as well.<br><br>The dominant method of defining disability assumes disability to be a medical &#x201c;problem&#x201d; with a clear &#x201c;cause&#x201d; that must be &#x201c;treated&#x201d; in an effort to find a &#x201c;cure.&#x201d; <br>This framework considers disability &nbsp;to stem from&nbsp; bodily-based&nbsp; defects and tends to define disabled &nbsp;people &nbsp;almost &nbsp;exclusively &nbsp;by those &nbsp;diagnostic &nbsp;defects <br>(and supposedly &nbsp;nondisabled &nbsp;people &nbsp;by their &nbsp;lack &nbsp;of such &nbsp;defects). <br>It erroneously presumes &nbsp;disability &nbsp;to be ahistorical&#x2014;that is, &nbsp;to have always&nbsp;had&nbsp;the&nbsp;same,&nbsp;unaltering &nbsp;definition.&nbsp;Such a narrow conception &nbsp;erases the widely diverse and rich lives of so many people with disabilities&#x2014;for &nbsp;whom &nbsp;disability likely matters, but who also define themselves according to and whose lives are shaped &nbsp;by race, sexuality, gender,&nbsp; class, political &nbsp;ideology, athleticism, their favorite&nbsp;hobby, whether or not they like yappy dogs, and the like. Disability can include disease or illness, but it often does not, and nondisabled people can be ill. Illness some- times leads to disability (but it often does not), and when it does the illness can go away but the disability remain. Illness, disease, and disability are not synonymous.<br><br>Defining disability is difficult&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s part of my argument. &nbsp;Although &nbsp;the definition theoretically &nbsp;has&nbsp; been based &nbsp;on bodies, the categorization of bodies as disabled has been shaped by factors such as gender, race, sexuality, education,&nbsp; levels of industrialization or standardization, access to adaptive &nbsp;equipment or privacy, &nbsp;and class. With age and medical care, as well as the vagaries of life, or simply daily context, one can move in and out of the category of &#x201c;people with disabilities.&#x201d; One can be temporarily disabled due to accident or illness. Disabilities can be easily &#x201c;read&#x201d; by others (signified by the presence of a wheelchair or the sounds of a speech impediment), or more difficult to discern (such as some psychological disabilities or neurological disabilities).<br><br>Disability can be contextual, and its meanings have changed over time. &nbsp;A simplistic example: &nbsp;a fellow historian and I once spent a delightful few days in Montreal at an academic conference. Those around me read my body as nondisabled. &nbsp;The white cane of my friend led others to read her as blind and disabled. Waiters and cab drivers always looked to me to take the lead. However, and to their dismay, I don&#x2019;t speak French. Luckily, my colleague is fluent in French. &nbsp;In that context, my linguistic deficiencies became far more of an impediment, far more disabling, than her blindness. &nbsp;Disability is not just a bodily category, but instead and also a social category shaped by changing social factors&#x2014;just as is able-bodiedness.<br><br>This is not to argue that we should all hold hands and cheerfully insist that we&#x2019;re all disabled in some way or another. &nbsp;That ignores the lived reality that disability can bring physical discomfort or difficulty. &nbsp;It also ignores the historical reality that being defined as disabled has made access to power and resources limited or difficult; and that hierarchies of power contribute to definitions of disability. &nbsp;For example, &nbsp;in the nineteenth &nbsp;century, medical&nbsp; experts &nbsp;argued &nbsp;that &nbsp;menstruation and reproduction so impaired women&#x2019;s bodies (those of middle and upper-class white women, &nbsp;at least) that &nbsp;their exclusion from higher education&nbsp; and employment &nbsp;was absolutely necessary, for themselves and for the greater &nbsp;good of society. &nbsp;And &nbsp;in the &nbsp;early twentieth &nbsp;century, &nbsp;if public transportation was not accessible, and employers &nbsp;refused to hire a man with only one leg, then exclusionary&nbsp; ideas and re- sources&#x2014;not &nbsp;the&nbsp; condition &nbsp;of being&nbsp; one-legged&#x2014;generated social segregation and unemployment. These are real consequences.</p><h2>Becoming Lincoln</h2><p><p></p><p> Shortlisted for the 2018 Lincoln Prize</p><p></p><p></p><p>Previous biographies of Abraham Lincoln&#x2015;universally acknowledged as one of America&#x2019;s greatest presidents&#x2015;have typically focused on his experiences in the White House. In <i>Becoming Lincoln</i>, renowned historian William Freehling instead emphasizes the prewar years, revealing how Lincoln came to be the extraordinary leader who would guide the nation through its most bitter chapter.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Freehling&#x2019;s engaging narrative focuses anew on Lincoln&#x2019;s journey. The epic highlights Lincoln&#x2019;s difficult family life, first with his father and later with his wife. We learn about the staggering number of setbacks and recoveries Lincoln experienced. We witness Lincoln&#x2019;s famous embodiment of the self-made man (although he sought and received critical help from others).</p><p></p><p></p><p>The book traces Lincoln from his tough childhood through incarnations as a bankrupt with few prospects, a superb lawyer, a canny two-party politician, a great orator, a failed state legislator, and a losing senatorial candidate, to a winning presidential contender and a besieged six weeks as a pre-war president.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As Lincoln&#x2019;s individual life unfolds, so does the American nineteenth century. Few great Americans have endured such pain but been rewarded with such success. Few lives have seen so much color and drama. Few mirror so uncannily the great themes of their own society. No one so well illustrates the emergence of our national economy and the causes of the Civil War.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The book concludes with a substantial epilogue in which Freehling turns to Lincoln&#x2019;s wartime presidency to assess how the preceding fifty-one years of experience shaped the Great Emancipator&#x2019;s final four years. Extensively illustrated, nuanced but swiftly paced, and full of examples that vividly bring Lincoln to life for the modern reader, this new biography shows how an ordinary young man from the Midwest prepared to become, against almost absurd odds, our most tested and successful president.</p><p></p></p><p><p>William W.

She lives with her family in South Florida with a yard full of palm trees that get wrapped in colourful Christmas lights every winter.PreSchool-Grade 1-In this fourth title about the habitual worrywart, the child is full of incessant questions about Christmas and Santa.

Mr Pooter is a man of modest ambitions, content with his ordinary life. Yet he always seems to be troubled by disagreeable tradesmen, impertinent young office clerks and wayward friends, not to mention his devil-may-care son Lupin with his unsuitable choice of bride. In the bumbling, absurd, yet ultimately endearing character of Pooter, the Grossmith brothers created a wonderful portrait of the class system and the inherent snobbishness of the suburban middle-class suburbia - one which sends up the late Victorian crazes for Aestheticism, spiritualism and bicycling, as well as the fashion for publishing diaries by anybody and everybody. This edition contains the original illustrations by Weedon Grossmith and an introduction by Ed Glinert, author of The London Compendium, discussing the novel&#39;s serialisation in Punch, the growth of the suburbs and the figure of Mrs Pooter. George Grossmith (1847-1912) initially worked as a journalist, reporting Police Court proceedings for The Times. In 1870 he began his career as a singer and entertainer, creating some of the most memorable characters in Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s operettas. Weedon Grossmith (1854-1919) brother of George, was educated at the Slade and the Royal Academy with a view to following a career as a painter, and exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery and the Royal Academy. Joining a theatre company in 1885, he toured the provinces and America. The best-known of his many plays, The Night of the Party, was published in 1901.

Make a statement like that to someone who's struggled for years with, say, rheumatoid arthritis, and be prepared for an eyeroll (at best). To Peter Fernando's credit, he makes that statement, and no such impulse arises. We believe him because he's been there himself and because he backs up the statements with his own real experiences and with real wisdom from the Buddhist teachings. Peter starts by defusing the pernicious belief that anyone is somehow responsible for their illness: You're not "wrong" for being sick. Then, having gotten past self-blame, one can begin to learn self-kindness. From there, one moves to mindfulness practices and cultivating body awareness--even if body awareness is distasteful when the body isn't behaving the way you like. Further topics include getting intimate with dark emotions (fear, despair, the scary future, frustration, grief, etc.), learning equanimity (rejoicing in the good fortune of those who don't share your suffering), cultivating healthy relationships in the midst of everything, and practical advice for living with pain. Each chapter comes with one or more practices or guided meditations for putting the teachings into practice.</p><p>PETER FERNANDO is cofounder of Original Nature Meditation Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. He was a monk in the Thai Forest tradition at Abhayagiri Monastery in Ukiah, California, where he trained under Ajahn Passano and Ajahn Amaro. He&#39;s currently a student of Sharda Rogell and Ajahn Sucitto. A longtime sufferer of chronic pain and various health problems himself, he&#39;s been working with others in that situation since 2009 on an individual basis in Wellington and Auckland and in groups regularly at the Wellington Multiple Sclerosis Society. He works with Berkeley-based Insight Meditation teacher James Baraz on a project called Insight through Illness, an online community of support for those addressing chronic illness through meditation: www.insight-illness.com.&#x201c;It is rare when a subject as difficult as illness is so thoroughly embodied that it becomes a gateway to the sacred. It is also exceptional when someone has the wisdom and skill to navigate the reader through that same portal. Peter Fernando&#x2019;s book, <i>Finding Freedom in Illness</i>, does both with such clarity and skill that it leaves the reader determined to use his/her whole life for the same purpose.&#x201d; -Rodney Smith, author of <i>Stepping Out of Self-Deception</i> and <i>Awakening: A Paradigm Shift of the Heart&nbsp;</i><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;</b>Meditation, and Awakening, is generally linked to sitting upright for long stretches of time, despite the fact that all of us some of the time (and some of us much of the time) can&#x2019;t physically manage to do so.

But it&#x2019;s not just for &#x2018;sick people&#x2019;: we are all of the nature to sicken, and by taking that into account, we can develop a practice for the &#x2018;bad&#x2019; times as well as the &#x2018;good&#x2019;.&#x201d; &#x2013;Ajahn Sucitto, author of<i> Turning the Wheel of Truth</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Finding Freedom in Illness</i> is a beautiful book to read.

When the young prince Kedryn Caitin defeated Taws and his forces, the Three Kingdoms joined in proclaiming him and Wynett begin life together, all are certain that the battle is over at last. But concealed by darkness, Ashar's anger simmers-and he waits. His minion may have failed. But his diabolical cause is not forgotten...A thrilling adventure of courage and magic by a remarkable new talent in fantasy, <b>The Books Of The Kingdoms.</b></p><p>"Angus Wells writes with a touch of magic. . .This is High Fantasy of the most exhilarating kind."--Robert Holdstock, author of <i>Mythago Wood</i><i>Prologue<br></i><br><br>He had not known pain until now; that sensation had been the preserve of mortal flesh and he had not thought to experience it. Nor had he anticipated a second defeat, yet that had come and with it such exquisite pain his preternatural senses exploded in disorder. Vision was gone; taste, smell, hearing lost; touch became an abstract, consumed beneath the raw wash of agony. His universe, his very being, was suffering, the pain overriding all save the one remaining sensation: fear. Fear was a permanent thing for all who served Ashar; more so for him, who was created of and by the god, who was so wholly Ashar's creature.<br><br>And fear possessed him now. He felt it in the deepest channels of his unnatural being, gripping him with a strength that slowly overcame the pain, relegating that anguish to a secondary status in his returning awareness.<br><br>He had failed his master again.<br><br>The once at the Lozin Gate, where the might of the Horde he had raised to bring Ashar's will to the Three Kingdoms broke against the determination of a single manling, and now again when that same weak creation of flesh and blood had stood against him, aided by no more than a weaker woman.<br><br>And the talisman, said a voice that was not a voice but a crescendo of agony within him.<br><br>He opened his eyes and saw only fire. Ashar's fire, that had sustained him and now seared him. He screamed, knowing the fury of his master, and the fire abated a fraction, enough that he could assess his situation, order his memories, sense the emptiness inside him.<br><br>"The talisman?" he asked in a voice that quavered, no longer confident.<br><br>Kyrie's talisman! The god spat the words as if even mention of the Lady's name was distasteful.<br><br>"She gave them power?" He saw a fragment of hope, a faint glimmer of optimism that glinted dimly through the threatening flames.<br><br>Estrevan gave them the stones; the two halves of the talisman. With those they defeated you.<br><br>He shuddered afresh. Had his eyes been capable of producing tears he would have wept, but they could not and instead he said, "Kedryn was blind."<br><br>Kedryn regained his sight, the god responded, he entered the netherworld with the woman and found the one you used to take his eyes. Borsus gave him back his sight.<br><br>"Borsus?" Disbelief was in his reply. "Borsus was my man. How might he aid Kedryn Caitin?"<br><br>Did I create so feeble a creature? The utter contempt stung him with a fiery lash. Do you know that all is a balance? That for each move of mine there is a countermove she&#x2013;again the single word was spat out&#x2013;may take? It is decreed so by a power greater even than mine, and that allowed the one they call the Chosen to gain back his lost sight. I had thought to outmaneuver her; thought that your suborning of the one called Hattim Sethiyan must win me the game, but it did not. You failed me, Taws.<br><br>He felt resentment then, and the god's knowledge of it brought pain afresh to the embodiment of his creation. He screamed, knowing the ululation was as music to his master and might thus placate the god. After what was either a little while or an eternity the anguish eased and he spoke again, fearfully, knowing that he pleaded for his very existence.<br><br>"I did not know he penetrated the netherworld. I did not know he had regained his sight. I did not know he possessed the half of the talisman, the woman the other."<br><br>And I could not warn you, said the god. She is strong in the Kingdoms&#x2013;stronger now for your defeat&#x2013;and I could only trust in you to do my will there.<br><br>"As I did," Taws moaned, cringing as the flames that surrounded him burned brighter. "Had I but known of the talismans I could have taken measures against their power."<br><br>You had knowledge of the ones whose souls you drank, countered Ashar. You had Kedryn Caitin and the woman called Wynett within your grasp.<br><br>Taws groaned, remembering the blue light, the quintessence of all he opposed, that had struck against him and quelled his own hellish fire. "I could not fight against the joined strength of the two halves," he gasped.<br><br>No, Ashar agreed, you could not. That power was too great, but it has shown me two things.<br><br>There was a pause that the cringing form of the mage took as hopeful until the god spoke again.<br><br>While that talisman exists I cannot hope to vanquish either Caitin or the Kingdoms. He holds the one part, his woman the other. Their love binds them as one, uniting the stone. While they, together, possess the cursed thing the balance is weighted in the Lady's favor. I must wrest both parts from them.<br><br>"The woman," Taws said quickly, "she will be his weakness; he hers. Separate them, let the one be bait for the other, the talisman the ransom for the captive's life."<br><br>It had occurred to me, responded Ashar with massive contempt. Indeed, I have begun my move. And this time I shall not be thwarted.<br><br>Taws smiled then, his fleshless lips stretching despite the pain of Ashar's fires. He asked, "What part do I play, Master?"<br><br>You have no part, answered the god, you have outlived your usefulness and I have no further need of you. What I do now, I do alone. Now Kedryn Caitin shall face me.<br><br>The smile upon Taws's mantis features became a rictus of inexpressible agony as the flames burned higher, brighter, becoming all that he knew, the core of his being until that gift of Ashar was taken back.<br>Within the farthest reaches of the Beltrevan, Caroc hunters trembled as flame lit the night sky, its brilliance dimming the light of the spring stars, midnight becoming as noonday in high summer. It seemed a rift was opened in the very skin of the world to give access to Ashar's fire, the roiling column stretching to the heavens, its outwash rendering the mightiest trees to pale ash that blew on the hellish wind, that awful gusting felling timber in a great corona about the central pyre. Birds roasted in the branches and small animals upon the ground, burrowing creatures died in their holes while others fled in stark terror from the conflagration, forest bulls running alongside the great cats, wolves pacing them, companions in fear with the deer that bounded, wide-eyed and oblivious of the predators, all unified in their desire to escape that ghastly holocaust.<br><br>No men were seriously harmed, for none ventured near that place where first, so legend had it, Ashar had brought the Messenger into the world. It was a place both sacred and cursed, for the Messenger had promised much and led the tribes of the Beltrevan down into defeat. Now, with peace agreed and the world turned on its head with a Kingdomer hef-Alador by swordright, it was deemed best to steer well clear. Consequently only a few suffered hurt, a handful struck by storm-tossed branches, some by charging bulls, a scattering burned by the more natural fire that followed the initial eruption. Most hurried to the more hospitable regions of the forest, wishing only to get themselves well clear of the raging flames, not wishing to know whether Ashar expressed his anger or lamented his defeat. That was something for the shamans to debate, and they would not come together until the time of the summer Gathering; honest warriors, having tasted the ashes of vanquishment, preferred now to go about their human business and leave the arguments of the gods to the deities.</p><h2>Louder, Lili</h2><p>Lili is the quietest kid in class. She spends recess inside with Lois, the class?s pet guinea pig, and allows Cassidy do her talking for her, even if it means never getting to have the best parts in games. Sometimes it?s just easier letting Cassidy be in charge, but will Lili have the courage to speak up when it means keeping Lois from getting hurt?<p> This warm, humorous story will speak to any child learning to find his or her own voice?and children used to being the boss might see themselves reflected in Cassidy?s over-the-top antics, as well.<br><br></p></p><p>Gennifer Choldenko is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling and Newbery Honor Award-winning author of ten children's books, including <i>Notes From a Liar and Her Dog</i>, <i>If a Tree Falls at Lunch Period</i>, <i>No Passengers Beyond this Point</i>, <i>Al Capone Does My Shirts</i>, <i>Al Capone Shines My Shoes</i>, and <i>Al Capone Does My Homework</i>. She lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her family.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;Lili is so shy and soft-spoken that she is almost invisible in her classroom. She fails to ask for what she wants and often ends up with what she doesn't want: a partner named Cassidy. Then one day, when Mrs. Backmeyer is absent and Cassidy is being cruel to the guinea pig, Lili finds her strongest, most forceful voice and commands respect: "Even the glue in the bottle stood still." This engaging story is well written and even poetic. Lili is a well-developed character, and her growth is believable. The warm, energetic illustrations highlight the elements of humor in the story, as when the substitute teacher is on her cell phone outside the room with the class visibly out of control within. Lili's facial expressions are priceless, especially as she shrieks "STOP IT!," and children will laugh at Cassidy's archlike pigtails, and at the birds and fish that line up along with the students. While shy youngsters may claim Lili, others will relate to her. This excellent title will spark discussions on feeling shy, practicing assertiveness, and dealing with bullies.&#x2014;<i>Barbara Katz, Parish Episcopal School, Dallas, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They allow you to fill your home with colour, without splashing statement brights around, and they bring a warmth and softness to a room. In Pretty Pastel Style, stylist Selina Lake shows you how to use this truly versatile colour palette to create beautiful spaces that are feminine without being girlie; colour-rich without being garish. The book first walks you through the Elements of the look. Modern Pastels are contrasted with pops of stronger shades and sharpened with statement furniture. Vintage Pastels plunder the past, taking from it smoky pinks, faded greens and elegant patterns. Retro Pastels cheerfully channel the ice-cream shades of the Fifties on candy stripes, polka dots and cute floral prints, while Simple Pastels work with off-whites for an elegantly minimal take on pretty pastel style. Next, Details looks at everything from furniture and lighting, to display and decoration, with inspiring ideas on how to piece the style together. Finally, head to the Spaces section of the book to see beautiful rooms that have used pastels with super-stylish effect.</p><p><p>Pastels are enjoying an exciting comeback.

This book looks at bitting, with five principal headings, beginning with an explanation of the development of bitting systems, culminating in those currently in use. The function of the bit within the combination of rational aids is defined and is followed by an examination of the equine mouth conformation as a factor governing choice. The bitting groups and the patterns which are available are all clearly explained, together with details of the action of each and their suitability to the purpose and the stage of training. Particular attention is paid to bridle fitting, construction and materials and there is a clear explanation of the influence of bitting auxiliaries (nosebands and martingales) on the action of the bit. Also included is a short section on common bitting problems and another on cleaning and maintenance.</p><p></p><h2>Northlanders Vol. 7: The Icelandic Trilogy</h2><p>Brian Wood (DMZ, DEMO, DV8) wraps up his critically acclaimed Vertigo series here in "The Icelandic Trilogy".<p>In this final chapter, NORTHLANDERS weaves together the decades-spanning crime drama of the Hauksson clan.

The story of this age-old, most extensive grain crop the world has ever seen, parallels that of mankind and author Kirby Brumfield makes the point clear. Wheat in the Northwest? Yes, it&#39;s all here, acres of it in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. The lore of the harvest is the keynote of Brumfield&#39;s presentation...the romance of growing and harvesting the crop, and the growing civilization of humanity, adept at improving its lot and more skilled at the mechanics of living...until in 1831 Cyrus McCormick demonstrated a reaper that revolutionized wheat harvesting. Brumfield approaches this vast subject with considerable facility and sows grains of interest in every paragraph. He lifts farming right out of the soil into fascinating history, with accent on the Northwest.</p><p></p><h2>To Hear Silence: Charlie Battery 1st Battalion 13th Marines: The First 15 Months</h2><p>To Hear Silence is the history of Charlie Battery, 1st Battalion, 13th Marines, from the time of its formation at Camp Horno, California, in July 1966, until the original members left Vietnam in early October 1967. Although partly written in narrative format, this book paints an accurate portrayal of the experiences of what really happened in 1966 and 1967 through its day-to-day, and often minute-to-minute, accounts of the members&#39; time in Vietnam.

He invaded the Persian Empire with 30,000 infantry and 5000 cavalry and in a series of dazzling campaigns, which included the battles of Issus and Gaugamela, he defeated Darius and was proclaimed King of Asia. His plans to conquer India were resisted by his men, and death cut short the ambitions of one of the greatest soldiers the world has ever known. He was the model for successors as notable as Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte, and his campaigns are still studied in military academies throughout the world. Major-General Fuller&#39;s book looks at the military achievements of one of the world&#39;s greatest conquerors.</p><p>Major General <b>J.F.C. Fuller</b> (1878-1966) was one of the most important and original military thinkers of this century. He served as lieutenant in the Boer War, organized the first British tank corps in World War I, and developed the strategy and tactics of tank warfare which were later put to such effective use by the Nazis for their World War II blitzkriegs. His many books include <i>A Military History of the Western World</i> (3 volumes), <i>The Generalship of Ulysses S.

Not death, but the removal of his fam. Without the augmentation of his brain by his electronic familiar, he can barely function amidst the bewildering complexities of everyday life on Splendid Wisdom. Here, on the capital world of the galaxy's Second Empire, everyone from the meanest citizen to the ruling Pscholars has depended upon a fam since childhood. Without one, simply navigating the streets and levels of the planetary megalopolis is a paralyzing challenge. Lost along with such everyday survival skills were many of Eron's memories and his professional knowledge. The crime he committed must have been terrible to warrant such a dreadful punishment. If only he could remember what it was!<br></p><p>Admirers of Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, possibly the greatest SF series ever, will be drawn to this oddly titled sequel from the author of the Hugo-nominated Courtship Rite (1982), but they shouldn't get their hopes too high. No one, including Asimov himself in his belated efforts to further milk his cash cow, has succeeded in capturing the breadth, excitement and imaginative scope of the original. Canadian Kingsbury, too, falls short. Nearly as long as the entire Asimov trilogy, this continuation suffers from long-windedness and a surfeit of italics. The author, though, does create a convincing and fresh simulacrum of the world of the 761st century. For a crime he can't remember, Eron Osa, a 30-year-old psychohistorian, must give up his fam, that is, his personal familiar, a device plugged into his brain that immeasurably enhances all aspects of his life, particularly his power to absorb and resolve problems. Members of the Second Galactic Empire populate the Milky Way galaxy of a million worlds, in which the only "aliens" are genetically engineered talking dogs. Some people, not much different from today's humans, behave admirably, while others are addicted to power and war. Women play only peripheral roles in a male-dominated universe. For all its ambitions, this work lacks the great storytelling qualities of Asimov's trilogy and captures only some of its ambience. (Nov. 13)story that appeared in Asimov's SF magazine. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Kingsbury continues exploration of the universe of Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels in his own imposing book. Nominally it is the story of Eron Osa, who arrives as a student in the capital of the fifteenth-millennium Galactic Empire. In due course he discovers that the Pscholars' monopoly of psychohistory is more dangerous than helpful to humanity. For that heretical realization, he is condemned to lose his <i>fam</i>, or embedded electronic alter ego. How he overcomes that hindrance and finds enough allies to overturn the orthodox Pscholars is another story, perhaps not as well developed as some might like. The real strength of the somewhat rambling novel lies in all the fascinating characters (e.g., Hyperlord Hahukum Konn, with his flying replica of a B-17, and Frightfulpersons Katana and her daughter Otaria, who live up to their titles) and settings encountered on the way to Osa's becoming savior of the galaxy--not to mention the number of satirical touches Kingsbury scores on history and sex. If not a great novel, then a very good, very absorbing one. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They settled in Rockland, Maine, where, as Jews and foreignors, they were ostracized. Louise, whose talent emerged early, grew up feeling alternatively superior and inferior. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; At twenty, to escape from Maine, she married a wealthy New Yorker and moved to Manhattan where she studied with some of the best art teachers of the time. As her dedication to art grew, she abandoned her husband and neglected her son--which caused her intense maternal guilt for the rest of her life. During the Depression, she joined other artists of her generation and worked for the Works Progress Administration.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she had her first solo exhibition in 1941, her real success did not comne until she was almost sixty, after she had gone through a period of extreme poverty that brought her close to despair. She found inspiration in cubism, primitive art and her own unconscious, creating a rich iconography of images. With black, white, or gold paint and perfect placement, she transformed old pieces of wood and other objects she picked up on the street into powerful sculptures.</p><h2>Essential Ultimate: Teaching, Coaching, Playing</h2><p><p><i>Essential Ultimate: Teaching, Coaching, Playing</i> will help you </p><p>-develop an Ultimate fitness and conditioning program,</p><p>-learn how to execute and teach the offensive and defensive skills and tactics of Ultimate,</p><p>-use progressive drills and game situations to refine skills and implement strategies,</p><p>-prepare psychologically for competition, and</p><p>-build team strength and unity. </p><p>Ultimate is one of the fastest-growing sports in schools, intramurals, rec centers, and clubs throughout the United States and the world.

The aim was to present a pictorial introduction to the flowering plants of particular areas that would help visitors to identify and appreciate them and their environment. Grampians National Park is recognised as Victoria&#39;s most important botanical reserve. More than 1000 flowering plants have been recorded for the region covered by this book, which takes in Black Range and Mount Arapiles-Tooan State Parks and Deep Lead Flora and Fauna Reserve as well as Grampians National Park. Of these, some 400 are illustrated in colour. Brief descriptions give common and scientific names, plant height and flowering season, and a letter code indicates in which part(s) of the region it is found. Many Grampians plants are colourful and abundant and can be seen by the casual observer. Others are small and hard to find, and make exploring the area an exciting and rewarding experience. This compact book is a pleasure just to look through, with its photos of white, pink, red, purple, blue, yellow, orange and green flowers, and it&#39;s an indispensable companion if you&#39;re visiting the Grampians. By revealing the region&#39;s treasures in the context of threats such as climate change, it vividly depicts what we stand to lose without proper care and protection.</p><p></p><h2>Living Into Art: Journeys Through Collage</h2><p>Stories of personal breakthroughs and transformation show how people with little or no art background can create successful and satisfying artwork with cut-magazine collage.

It examines . . . the problem of the Good, time, and the relationship with the other [person] as a movement toward the Good.&#34; First published in 1947, and written mostly during Levinas&#39;s imprisonment during World War II, this work provides the first sketch of his mature thought?later developed fully in Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence. This new edition marks the first time this important work has been made available in an inexpensive paperback edition. Levinas&#39;s project in Existence and Existents is to move from anonymous existence to the emergence of subjectivity; to subjectivity&#39;s practice, theory and morality; to its encounter with the alterity of the other person. He is concerned here primarily with the time of the solitary subject; time is the inner structure of subjectivity, of the movement of existing. &#34;Levinas&#39;s work,&#34; says Alphonso Lingis, &#34;contains not only wholly new analyses of the forms of time?of the present, the past, the future?but also a new conception of the work of time.&#34; Beginning with Existence and Existents, then, it is possible to begin tracing the progressive &#34;alterization&#34; of time as it unfolds across the development of Levinas&#39;s entire philosophy. As a &#34;preparatory&#34; study, Existence and Existents introduces the major themes and concerns that occupied Levinas throughout his career. This is essential reading for understanding both Levinas&#39;s own philosophy and the developments in philosophical thought in the twentieth century.</p><p>EMMANUEL LEVINAS, a major voice in twentieth century philosophical thought, died in late 1995. After studying under Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger in the late 1920s, Levinas went on to develop a philosophical system that placed ethics at its center. His writings have influenced several generations of French philosophers, including Jacques Derrida, and have won him an admiring audience among theologians.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Identities in Motion: Asian American Film and Video</h2><p>This innovative book shows how Asian American filmmakers and videomakers frame and are framed by history&#x2014;how they define and are defined by cinematic projections of Asian American identity. Combining close readings of films and videos, sophisticated cultural analyses, and detailed production histories that reveal the complex forces at play in the making and distributing of these movies, <i>Identities in Motion</i> offers an illuminating interpretative framework for assessing the extraordinary range of Asian American films produced in North America.<br>Peter X Feng considers a wide range of works&#x2014;from genres such as detective films to romantic comedies to ethnographic films, documentaries, avant-garde videos, newsreels, travelogues, and even home movies. Feng begins by examining movies about three crucial moments that defined the American nation and the roles of Asian Americans within it: the arrival of Chinese and Japanese women in the American West and Hawai&#x2019;i; the incorporation of the Philippines into the U.S. empire; and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. In subsequent chapters Feng discusses cinematic depictions of ideological conflicts among Asian Americans and of the complex forces that compel migration, extending his nuanced analysis of the intersections of sexuality, ethnicity, and nationalist movements. <br><i>Identities in Motion</i> illuminates the fluidity of Asian American identities, expressing the diversity and complexity of Asian Americans&#x2014;including Filipinos, Indonesians, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Laotians, Indians, and Koreans&#x2014;from the nineteenth to the twenty-first century.</p><p>&#34;Identities, Peter X Feng reminds us in this perceptive work, elude capture. They are always in motion. Moreover, even as cinema in the U.S. defines the American subject, spectators ultimately determine their identities. Not content with a reading of text and context in Asian American cinema, although he offers that in great detail, Feng seeks out the creative imagination that rubs against cinematic conventions and inspires both the maker and spectator.&#34;--Gary Y.

In several waves of repression, thousands of Cathars were killed. Yet so ardent was their faith that, early in the next century, the Cathars rose one last time.

Instead he leads us through the story of music as it happened, idea by idea, so that each musical innovation -- harmony, notation, sung theatre, the orchestra, dance music, recording, broadcasting -- strikes us with its original force. He focuses on what changed when and why, picking out the discoveries that revolutionised man-made sound and bringing to life musical visionaries from the little-known P�rotin to the colossus of Wagner. Along the way, he also gives refreshingly clear descriptions of what music is and how it works: what scales are all about, why some chords sound discordant and what all post-war pop songs have in common.<br><br><i>The Story of Music</i> is the story of our urge to invent, connect, rebel -- and entertain. Howard Goodall's beautifully clear and compelling account is both a hymn to human endeavour and a groundbreaking map of our musical journey.</p><p>HOWARD GOODALL is an Emmy, BRIT and BAFTA award-winning composer of choral music (<i>Eternal Light: A Requiem</i>), stage musicals (<i>The Hired Man, Love Story</i>), film and TV scores -- among them <i>The Vicar of Dibley, Q.I., Red Dwarf, Blackadder</i> and <i>Into the Storm</i>. He was awarded the CBE in 2011 for service to music education.*Starred Review* Most of us take music for granted, and yet, as explained in this insightful exploration on the origins of music, someone had to come up with harmony and rhythm; someone had to create musical notation. &#x201c;Someone, somewhere, thought of them first.&#x201d; Though Goodall&#x2019;s primary focus is on Western music, that doesn&#x2019;t mean he ignores other musical cultures. He begins with what he calls the Age of Discovery (40,000 BCE to 1450 CE), exploring the musical origins of our hunter-gatherer ancestors, since music, he asserts, played an important role in ritual, communication, and language development. He moves on to the ancient Greeks, who believed studying music could produce &#x201c;nobler&#x201d; human beings. He discusses plainchant and polyphony, explains the &#x201c;huge&#x201d; implications of Gutenberg&#x2019;s movable-type printing on the dissemination of music as well as other landmarks in musical history, including the birth of opera; the invention of the piano; technological recording breakthroughs; the evolution of the blues, jazz, and rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll; and the worldwide popularity of hip-hop. Major musical figures are featured prominently, too, from Mozart to Beethoven, Wagner, Mahler, Stravinsky, and Brecht, on to Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, and Stephen Sondheim. With playlists for each chapter, this is a masterful and illuminating whirlwind tour through thousands of years of musical history. --June Sawyers</p><h2>Tigers Over China: The Aircraft of the A.V.G (EagleFiles, No. 4)</h2><p>EagleFiles #4 supplements the histories and biographies that have been published on the A.V.G.

Brought up in a Whitstable oyster parlour, Nan Astley is 18 when she first sees Kitty Butler, a male impersonator (or masher), perform on the stage of the Canterbury Palace of Varieties. Having fallen instantly in love with Kitty, Nan is thrilled to be invited to become Kitty&#39;s dresser and move with her to London. During their first year together, the girls&#39; relationship becomes physical and passionate, and Nan joins Kitty on the music hall stage as a male impersonator. But Nan&#39;s happiness is shattered when she discovers Kitty in bed with the girls&#39; manager and mentor, Walter Bliss. Heartbroken, Nan runs away from her life in the music halls to live alone in sordid lodgings. She sets herself up as a male prostitute, making use of the costumes from her previous life as an impersonator. Whilst working as a renter, Nan is picked up by wealthy lesbian Diana Lethaby, who installs her in her luxurious St. John&#39;s Wood home as her live-in &#39;tart&#39;. Initially, Nan throws herself wholeheartedly into the glamorous lifestyle and sado-masochistic fantasies of Diana and her sapphic friends from the Cavendish Ladies&#39; Club. Eventually, however, she rebel and finds herself once more destitute and alone on the streets of London. Struggling to find a means of survival, Nan recalls a previous encounter with a woman called Florence, a socialist and supporter of women&#39;s rights, who runs a hostel for women in distress. Nan seeks her out in the East End of London, and manages to inveigle her way into her private home, which she shares with her brother Ralph and an orphaned baby whom brother and sister are raising together. Nan realises that with Florence she has at last found the emotional fulfilment and security she has long been seeking.</p><p>The heroine of Sarah Waters's audacious first novel knows her destiny, and seems content with it. Her place is in her father's seaside restaurant, shucking shellfish and stirring soup, singing all the while. "Although I didn't long believe the story told to me by Mother--that they had found me as a baby in an oyster-shell, and a greedy customer had almost eaten me for lunch--for eighteen years I never doubted my own oysterish sympathies, never looked far beyond my father's kitchen for occupation, or for love." At night Nancy Astley often ventures to the nearby music hall, not that she has illusions of being more than an audience member. But the moment she spies a new male impersonator--still something of a curiosity in England circa 1888--her years of innocence come to an end and a life of transformations begins.<p> <i>Tipping the Velvet</i>, all 472 pages of it, is as saucy, as tantalizing, and as touching as the narrator's first encounter with the seductive but shame-ridden Miss Kitty Butler. And at first even Nancy's family is thrilled with her gender-bending pal, all but her sister, best friend, and bedmate, Alice, "her eyes shining cold and dull, with starlight and suspicion." Not to worry. Soon Nancy and Kitty are off to London, their relationship close though (alas for our heroine) sisterly. We know that bliss will come, and it does, in an exceptionally charged moment. A lesser author would have been content to stop her story there, but Waters has much more in mind for her buttonholing heroine, and for us. In brief, her Everywoman with a sexual difference goes from success onstage to heartbreak to a stint as a male prostitute (necessity truly <i>is</i> the mother of invention) to keeping house for a brother and sister in the Labour movement. And did I mention her long stint as a plaything in the pleasure palace of a rich Sapphist extraordinaire? Diana Lethaby is as cruel as she is carnal, and even the well-concealed Cavendish Ladies' Club isn't <i>outr�</i> enough for her. Kitting Nancy out in full, elegant drag, she dares the front desk to turn them away. "We are here," she mocks, "for the sake of the irregular." </p><p> Only after some seven years of hard twists and sensual turns does Nancy conclude that a life of sensation is not enough. Still, <i>Tipping the Velvet</i> is so entertaining that readers will wish her sentimental--and hedonistic--education had taken twice as long. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p><p> <b><b>Sarah Waters</b>&nbsp;</b>is the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Little Stranger</i>, <i>The Night Watch</i>, <i>Fingersmith</i>,<i> </i><i>Affinity, </i>and <i>Tipping the Velvet.</i>&nbsp;She&nbsp;has three times been short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, twice been a finalist for the Orange Prize, and was&nbsp;named one of&nbsp;<i>Granta</i>&#x2019;s best&nbsp;young British&nbsp;novelists, among other distinctions.

Olson's popular books, including The Singing Wilderness, Listening Point, and Reflections from the North Country, are beloved by generations of readers, and frequently appeared on best-seller lists across the nation. The lyricism and evocative beauty of his prose became a model for nature writers like Barry Lopez and Annie Dillard. Olson was a recipient of the John Burroughs Medal, the highest honor in nature writing.<br>A Wilderness Within looks beyond the environmental battles and books to reveal the inner forces that drove Sigurd Olson. Backes details Olson's painful path to becoming a writer, and the physical and emotional toll that his activism and writing took from him. For this biography, Backes conducted interviews with Olson's family and had complete access to Olson's papers, diaries, correspondence, and photographs.</p><p>This well-balanced assessment of Sigurd Olson (1899-1982) pays as much attention to his spiritual quest as to his activism in defense of America's natural resources with such groups as The Wilderness Society and the National Parks Association. Olson found a sense of completeness while hiking, canoeing, and hunting in the northern Midwest. He conveys these feelings in influential books such as <i>The Singing Wilderness</i>, which inspired a generation of younger nature writers. David Backes, who knew Olson in his later years, captures his personality and evaluates his achievements in lucid prose.Backes (Canoe Country: An Embattled Wilderness, not reviewed) knits together a yeomanly portrait of Olson, a force in the mid-20th-century environmental movement, but someone today's readers may find a bit of a dinosaur. Olson will best be remembered for authoring such conservationist hymnals as The Singing Wilderness and Reflections from the North Country, where he vented his land aesthetics and spiritual beliefs. His ego was such that, after reading Thoreau, he felt ``no one has as yet developed a philosophy of the wilderness. That is up to me.'' And it is to the credit of Backes--an unabashed Olson fan who treats his papers and diaries as if they were sacred relics--that he includes such nuggets. The son of a strong-willed Swedish Baptist minister, Olson evolved a kind of wilderness theology--a love of all life in God's cosmic adventure--that found ``ritualistic significance'' in the uncivilized world. These days, Olson's writing feels by turns overly manly (``My work must be strong and hard and masculine'') and overly sentimental; readers may well agree with the Houghton Mifflin editor who rejected Olson's first collection: ``Essays . . . have to be superbly written to have a chance, and Sig Olson's prose is not on that level.'' Thus Backes wisely devotes significant space to Olson's championing such then-crazy notions as roadless areas and air reservations (patches over which no flights are allowed) and to making sense of a man who bridled at the thought of being behind a desk, who would rather have been in a canoe, yet accepted numerous administrative posts, from college dean to president of the Wilderness Society, with many a bureaucratic stop between, hating them all the while. Impeccably researched, near-claustrophobically detailed, evenhanded--Backes's volume gives a sense of the Olson behind the legend. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

To keep a balance in our global ecosystem, we need to use resources efficiently, equitably, and sustainably. In both nature and economics, we observe that when a healthy distribution of resources is achieved, systems can not only function but flourish.<br><br></p><p>The United States recycles roughly 34% of its waste and has been stuck at this level for decades. Recycling brings a balance to our system by managing resources in a loop. When done well, it benefits communities and the environment. Individuals are a key part of connecting this loop because we provide a supply of materials and a demand for new recycled products. But many of us don&#x2019;t know what happens after those items leave our homes. We&#x2019;re confused by inconsistent rules of what we can and can&#x2019;t recycle. Our confusion has huge consequences and is a reason why our recycling is stuck. Throughout Reduce, Reuse, Reimagine, Beth Porter provides answers to clear up that confusion, and shares great resources about recycling, explaining the complexity, guiding individual action, and contextualizing its history. This book reveals how we arrived at this state of dysfunction, and what steps we need to employ to be an active participant in strengthening our recycling system. Nature knows how to recycle itself, decomposing waste back into the soil to continue the circle of growth. We should follow its lead.</p></p><p>Beth Porter is Green America&#x2019;s Climate &amp; Recycling Director. Beth creates content and resources to help people curb their waste and improve recycling habits. She lives and works in Washington, D.C. Reduce, Reuse, Reimagine is her first book.Reduce, Reuse, Reimagine offers the reader a concrete social and scientific framework for exploring the recycling system for materials that are integral to solutions to the larger issues of environmental sustainability and economic development in our consumer-based society. Failing to recognize the importance of mitigating consumption leaves us awash in oceans of garbage of our own making. Porter, a first-time author and nonprofit climate program director, offers a responsible point of view in nine easy pieces ranging from recycling&#x2019;s patriotic beginnings in WW II to the psychology of consumption and its economic drivers emerging today from the remnants of the throw-away society that was its legacy. Between the covers of this important and timely book, readers will find useful and often interesting tips, as well as chapter notes, citations, and a working index. It may be about trash, but trash it is not: it is rather a vitally useful work that reminds readers of the need for effective waste management and recycling practices in this age of global climate change. Recommended. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Porter, climate and recycling director for the nonprofit Green America, offers a succinct treatise on the history, efficacy, and future of recycling and waste disposal in her informative debut. She begins with the history of recycling as a patriotic act during WWII and includes delightful details about the ubiquity of victory gardens and the social pressure exerted by scrap drives. Revelations about the aggressive marketing done by manufacturers to convince Americans that waste is their personal failing (and not one that industry holds responsibility for) sit alongside direct, actionable advice on lessening one&#x2019;s environmental impact. Porter also discusses what she terms environmental racism; for example, the seizure of indigenous lands for production and harvesting, and the overwhelming placement of landfills and incinerators in black or Hispanic communities. Porter also delves into the individual recycling rates of specific materials such as plastic (less than 10% globally) vs. steel (92% in the U.S.), stresses the importance of buying recycled materials, and concludes with a list of concrete steps for being a better environmental steward. Porter&#x2019;s prose is direct and backed with overwhelming data, as well as examples of functional recycling models in various cities and countries worldwide. This heartfelt plea from a dedicated environmentalist is a clear guide to responsible waste management. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>We&#x2019;ve all heard that recycling isn&#x2019;t working anymore in the U.S., but we&#x2019;re not hearing how we can fix it. Beth Porter takes us beyond the act of recycling itself to an understanding of the ways in which we use and waste materials as a society, and maps out the solutions we can start implementing today in our communities and in our homes. (Todd Larsen, Executive Co-Director, Green America)<br><br>Beth Porter presents an image of recycling as a tiny acorn that with nurturing can to grow into a viable system that greatly benefits the country financially and environmentally. She then presents a history and the practice of recycling in the US. At a time when China's recycling policies are roiling the recycling world, her book is important for both specialists and the public at large. (Neil Seldman, PhD, Director, Waste to Wealth, Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Washington, DC)<br><br>Porter delivers a thoughtful rallying cry for one of the most basic and misunderstood environmental acts we can all take. This is a helpful primer for anyone interested in the future of recycling at a moment when many are wondering if the economics behind it can still work.

His courage is a model for all Americans."<br>--President Barack Obama</strong><p>It was just another day on the job for fifty-three-year-old Richard Phillips, captain of the <em>Maersk Alabama</em>, the United States-flagged cargo ship which was carrying, among other things, food and agricultural materials for the World Food Program. That all changed when armed Somali pirates boarded the ship. The pirates didn't expect the crew to fight back, nor did they expect Captain Phillips to offer himself as hostage in exchange for the safety of his crew. Thus began the tense five-day stand-off, which ended in a daring high-seas rescue when U.S. Navy SEALs opened fire and picked off three of the captors.</p><p>"It never ends like this," Captain Phillips said.</p><p>And he's right.</p><p><em>A Captain's Duty</em> tells the life-and-death drama of the Vermont native who was held captive on a tiny lifeboat off Somalia's anarchic, gun-plagued shores. A story of adventure and courage, it provides the intimate details of this high-seas hostage-taking--the unbearable heat, the death threats, the mock executions, and the escape attempt. When the pirates boarded his ship, Captain Phillips put his experience into action, doing everything he could to safeguard his crew. And when he was held captive by the pirates, he marshaled all his resources to ensure his own survival, withstanding intense physical hardship and an escalating battle of wills with the pirates. This was it: the moment where training meets instinct and where character is everything. Richard Phillips was ready.</p></p><p>Captain Richard Phillips grew up in Underhill VT, with seven brothers and sisters. He married Andrea Coggio in 1988--she is an emergency room nurse--and together they have two children. Phillips is a 1979 graduate of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy and became captain of the MV <em>Maersk Alabama</em> in 2009.Captain Richard Phillips&#39;s modest first-person account of the 2009 capture of his cargo vessel, the MAERSK ALABAMA, celebrates the little-understood and even-less-appreciated responsibilities of the U.S. Merchant Marines. Former broadcast journalist George Wilson provides an authoritative, dramatic, and at times, appropriately humorous tone to the story of the captain and crew as they face off against cutthroat Somali pirates. Wilson&#39;s precise delivery is true to the author&#39;s style and easily holds the listener&#39;s attention. A thumbnail sketch of Phillips&#39;s early years provides an effective backdrop for the terrifying seizure of his vessel and the gripping days that followed. Wilson&#39;s upbeat narrative style also provides an enlightening look at the sophisticated technology on the world&#39;s ocean-going vessels.

Behind the convenient and trusted disguise of &#39;Mammy&#39;, she transformed domestic labor into enterprise, amassed remarkable real estate, wealth, and power, and gained notoriety for her work in fighting Jim Crow. Pleasant&#39;s legacy is steeped in scandals and lore. Was she a voodoo queen who traded in sexual secrets? A madam? A murderer?In &#34;The Making of Mammy Pleasant&#34;, Lynn M.

Yet one day, he began to consider how very little he knew about the ordinary things of life as he found it in that comfortable home. To remedy this, he formed the idea of journeying about his house from room to room to &#x201c;write a history of the world without leaving home.&#x201d; The bathroom provides the occasion for a history of hygiene; the bedroom, sex, death, and sleep; the kitchen, nutrition and the spice trade; and so on, as Bryson shows how each has fig­ured in the evolution of private life. Whatever happens in the world, he demonstrates, ends up in our house, in the paint and the pipes and the pillows and every item of furniture. <br><br>Bill Bryson has one of the liveliest, most inquisitive minds on the planet, and he is a master at turning the seemingly isolated or mundane fact into an occasion for the most diverting exposi­tion imaginable.

While walking through his own home, a former Church of England rectory built in the 19th century, Bryson reconstructs the fascinating history of the household, room by room. With waggish humor and a knack for unearthing the extraordinary stories behind the seemingly commonplace, he examines how everyday items--things like ice, cookbooks, glass windows, and salt and pepper--transformed the way people lived, and how houses evolved around these new commodities. "Houses are really quite odd things," Bryson writes, and, luckily for us, he is a writer who thrives on oddities. He gracefully draws connections between an eclectic array of events that have affected home life, covering everything from the relationship between cholera outbreaks and modern landscaping, to toxic makeup, highly flammable hoopskirts, and other unexpected hazards of fashion. Fans of Bryson's travel writing will find plenty to love here; his keen eye for detail and delightfully wry wit emerge in the most unlikely places, making <i>At Home</i> an engrossing journey through history, without ever leaving the house. <em>--Lynette Mong</em><br> <br>BILL BRYSON's books include <b>A Walk in the Woods</b>, <b>I'm a Stranger Here Myself</b>, <b>In a Sunburned Country</b>, <b>Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words</b>, <b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b>, <b>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid</b> and <b>Bryson's Dictionary for Writers and Editors</b>.

Relevant and insightful, this Autobiography offers King&#39;s seldom discussed views on some of the world&#39;s greatest and most controversial figures including John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Mahatma Gandhi and Richard Nixon. This book brings to life a remarkable man whose thoughts and actions speak to our most burning contemporary issues and still inspire our desires, hopes and dreams.</p><p>By weaving together an unprecedented amount of material, including Dr. King's books, articles, essays, personal letters, and unpublished manuscripts, Clayborne Carson (historian, documentarian, and director of the King Papers Project) has crafted an excellent production that represents the unique medium of audiobooks at its very best. With the effective and engaging narration of actor Levar Burton as a foundation, the tapes provide understanding and insight into this important religious and political leader's powerful convictions.

Following an analysis of the forms and functions of the featured Apple products, the book provides an explanation of the innovative production methods and materials applied. Last but not least, it examines Apple design&#x2019;s overt references to the simplified forms of the products manufactured by the great German brand Braun, and enumerates the famous &#x201c;Ten Rules for Good Design&#x201d; promulgated by the company&#x2019;s chief designer, Dieter Rams, showing in each case how Apple has deployed and fulfilled them.</p><p>Apple Design delves into about 200 such products, most of which have been overseen by Jonathan Ive, the company&#x2019;s vice president of industrial design (not to mention the late great Steve Jobs himself).

For 25 years, she's drawn readers into her spell, spinning modern-day fables with a grace rarely seen.<p>Now she presents a book of previously uncollected short stories, full of beautiful dragons, rueful princesses, and handsome bards, and written in the gorgeous - and often surprisingly funny - prose she's known for. This is her world, wrapped up in the finery of fairy tales.</p></p><p>Patricia A. McKillip is a winner of the World Fantasy Award, and the author of many fantasy novels, including <b>The Riddlemaster of Hed</b> trilogy, <b>Stepping from the Shadows</b>, and <b>The Cygnet and the Firebird</b>. She lives in Oregon.Starred Review. As shown in this excellent story collection, World Fantasy Award&#x2013;winner McKillip (<i>Od Magic</i>) can take the most common fantasy elements&#x2014;dragons and bards, sorcerers and shape-shifters&#x2014;and reshape them in surprising and resonant ways. In "The Harrowing of the Dragon of Hoarsbreath," a man determined to drive off a fearsome dragon learns that pride can be as cold and monstrous as any beast. "The Snow Queen" and "The Lion and the Lark" (based on <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>) clothe old classics in new magic to examine the price of identity and the value of freedom. The bleak "Star-Crossed" details the official investigation into the deaths of Romeo and Juliet, while "Voyage into the Heart" tells of the heartless hunt to capture a unicorn's horn. "Baba Yaga and the Sorcerer's Son" is full of charm and humor, while the sly "Toad" reveals a frog prince who is far from innocent. Each of these tales is a gem of storytelling, a rich treasure for both fans and those yet to discover McKillip's deceptively simple magic. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But when pandemonium breaks out at the inaugural ceremony of the new Arkham Asylum, the combined forces of Oracle, Huntress and Catwoman aren't enough help for Batman and The Caped Crusader takes on an unlikely ally - The Penguin! Chock full of fan-favorite characters and the debuts of new supporting cast members, this high-speed adventure is sure to hit the spot for Batman fans who like their comics bursting with mystery, action and fun. And you won't believe your eyes when Batman uncovers the Black Mask's true identity!<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>Tony S. Daniel</b> decided to be a comics artist in the eighth grade, and he hasn't looked back since. After making his professional debut in 1993 on Comico's&nbsp;<i>The Elementals,</i>&nbsp;he has contributed to Marvel's <i>X-Force</i> and Image's <i>Spawn: Bloodfeud</i> as well as writing and illustrating his own titles&nbsp;<i>Silke, The Tenth,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>F5</i>, which led him into work in Hollywood. After being lured back into comics to work with writer Geoff Johns on <i>Teen Titans</i>, Daniel went on to draw <i>The Flash</i> before landing his dream job pencilling <i>Batman</i>. The Batcave is, he reports, surprisingly cozy.A man takes cautious first steps into the heroic role once held by his mentor in a story that hits all the expected notes of the superhero genre but doesn't do anything to impress. Daniel, known mainly for his skills as an artist, also takes on the writer's role for this story of Dick Grayson stepping into Batman's boots following the disappearance and presumed death of Bruce Wayne. Grayson must prove himself as skillful a detective as his predecessor while instigating a resurgence of a Black Mask-led criminal gang that's using mind-altering technology to recruit innocent civilians to commit violent crimes. In dealing with Bruce Wayne's former allies and enemies, Dick begins to prove that he is capable of being Batman but will do so in his own style. Daniel's writing is not nearly as strong as his artistic ability, and he often stumbles over a disjointed collection of subplots that pop in and out of the main story. While this is a noteworthy step in the history of a beloved fictional character's cast, it's not an otherwise memorable tale. (Oct.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

I'm certainly not going to miss the British weather. I'll miss a lot of other things, but not this.<br><br>I stare out of the window, down the gravel drive and out across the park of Blaystock Manor. I'm here filling in with some temp work, while I wait to take up my dream job, my chance of a lifetime working in the Caribbean at a luxury resort as a junior manager. This gig is just cleaning and helping with renovations, donkey work really, but it's all extra money to pay for my new tropical wardrobe.<br><br>Actually, it's a free day today. The marquess is pretty good about that. We get plenty of time off, plenty of breaks and other perks, and despite the fact he's strapped for cash and putting everything into this project, we're pretty well paid for our labors. Everyone else has gone off in a minibus to visit a local monastery where they brew apple brandy and make luxury biscuits and stuff, but me, I've got my own diversions here.<br><br>I'm alone in the house. Even the marquess drove off a short while ago in his decrepit gray Jag. And I'm free to indulge my wicked secret vice.<br><br>I discovered this little sitting room a couple days ago, when I was a bit lost and searching for the Blue Salon, where I was supposed to be polishing the floor. I stumbled in here and found a room that was homely and pretty lived-in, and sort of cozy. And, being irredeemably nosy, when I saw an old VCR and a bunch of tapes, I had to investigate.<br><br>Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! What a shock I got.<br><br>And now, while the house is empty, I slip another tape into the machine and settle down in a battered old leather armchair to watch it.<br><br>It's a home movie. Filmed, I think, in this very room. And it stars my latest crush, the marquess himself, and a woman who must have been his girlfriend at the time. Obviously it was taped many years ago, because His Lordship had short hair then, and now it's long, down to his shoulders.<br><br>Here he is, possibly sitting in this very chair. His knees are set wide apart and his girlfriend is facedown across them.<br><br>He's spanking her.<br><br>He's really laying it on with his long, powerful hand, and she's squirming and patently loving it!<br><br>And I'm loving it, too, and I don't really know why. Okay, I knew people played spanking games for sexual kicks, and I'd sort of hinted to various boyfriends that I'd like to try it. But it's never happened and I've never really worried about that.<br><br>But now. Now I've seen it. I bloody well want it!<br><br>I'm so turned on now I can barely see straight. And I certainly can't stay still in my chair. I'm sweating and my skin feels like it's already been spanked, all over. And between my legs, I'm drenched, my panties sopping with intense, almost inexplicable arousal. My sex is aching, tight and hungry, as if I want to be fucked right now, but at the same time have my bottom thrashed, just like the woman in the video.<br><br>The marquess really seems to be enjoying her pleasure, even though his cool, handsome face is exquisitely impassive. It's an old, well-worn tape, but I can still see the mask of stern, beautiful composure that he affects... and the wicked dark twinkle in his eyes.<br><br>It's no good, I've got to play with myself. I can't help it and I can't bear it if I don't. My sex is so heavy and so tense, I've just got to do it.<br><br>As the woman on the screen writhes and wriggles and shrieks as His Lordship's hand comes down, I unzip my jeans and shuffle them down to my knees, dragging my soggy panties with them. There's something wickedly lewd about sitting here with my clothes at half-mast like this, and the forbidden exposure only excites me more and makes my need to touch my body ever more urgent.<br><br>"Oh, God..." I murmur vaguely as I slip my fingers between my legs and find my clit. It's swollen and ready for my touch like a throbbing button. I flick it lightly and my vagina flutters dangerously. On the screen, the spanked girl tries to touch her own sex, wriggling her hand beneath her belly as she squirms and cries, but the marquess pauses midspank and gently remonstrates with her.<br><br>"Come, come, Sylvia, you know you mustn't do that. No pleasure until you've been a good girl and taken your punishment."<br><br>His voice is soft, even, but shot through with sweet steel and authority. It pushes me closer to coming just as powerfully as the spanking show does. I suddenly wish I could get to know him better, and make this all real.<br><br>"Oh, my lord..." I whisper this time, closing my eyes and turning on an inner video. This time it's me across those strong thighs. Me who's writhing and moaning, with my bottom flaming.<br><br>Oh, the picture is so clear. And it's the marquess of today who's doing the business, not the one in the video.<br><br>He's wearing his usual outfit of black jeans and black shirt, and his beautiful hair is loose on his shoulders like sheets of silk. There's a sly, slight smile on his pale, chiseled face, and his long, cultured hand comes down with metronomic regularity.<br><br>I'm rubbing myself hard now, beating at my clit, but not stroking the very apex of it. I daren't; I'm so excited and I don't want to come yet. In my fantasy, he allows me to touch myself while he's smacking me.<br><br>I writhe and wriggle, both fighting the pleasure and savoring its gathering at the same time. I throw my thighs wide, rubbing my bottom against the seat of the creaky old armchair. The sensation of the smooth surface against my skin is even more pervy. I press down harder, squashing my anus against the leather. I imagine him spanking me there, and even though I've no idea what it would really feel like, I groan, wanting it more and more and more.<br><br>"Oh, my lord... do it... do it..." I burble, eyes tightly closed and half out of my mind with desire and longing.<br><br>"Actually, my dear, I think you're 'doing it' quite well enough on your own. Do continue."<br><br>What?<br><br>It's like I'm falling, dropping through reality into a parallel universe. I know what's happened, but somehow I can't stop rubbing myself.<br><br>My eyes fly open though, and there he is.<br><br>The marquess.<br><br>Somehow he's walked into the room without me realizing it, moving softly on the rubber soles of his black running shoes.<br><br>In a few split seconds, I take in his glorious appearance.<br><br>So tall, so male, so mysterious. Long, dark hair, pale smiling face, long fit body. Dressed in his customary black shirt and jeans, his elegant hands flexing as if preparing to copy the actions of his image on the screen.<br><br>I snatch my hand from my crotch and make as if to struggle back into my jeans. My face is scarlet, puce, flaming.... I'm almost peeing myself.<br><br>"No, please...continue."<br><br>His voice is low and quiet, almost humming with amusement and intense interest. It's impossible to disobey him. Despite the fact that I think the aristocracy is an outdated nonsense, he's nobility to his fingertips and I'm just a pleb, bound to obey.<br><br>Unable to tear my eyes away from him, I watch as he settles his long frame down into the other chair, across from mine. He gives me a little nod, making his black hair sway, and then turns his attention to the images on the screen.<br><br>So do I, but with reluctance.<br><br>But I do as he wishes and begin to stroke my clit again.<br><br>Oh, God, the woman on the screen is really protesting now. Oh, God, in my mind, that woman is me, and I'm laid across the marquess's magnificent thighs with my bottom all pink and sizzling and my crotch wetting his jeans with seeping arousal.<br><br>I imagine the blows I've never experienced, and just the dream of them makes my clit flutter wildly and my vagina clench and pulse. I seem to see the carpet as I writhe and wiggle and moan, and at the same time his beautiful face, rather grave, but secretly smiling.<br><br>As his eyes twinkle in my imagination, I come.<br><br>It's a hard, wrenching orgasm. Shocking and intense. I've never come like that before in my life. It goes on and on, so extreme it's almost pain, and afterward I feel tears fill my eyes.<br><br>Talk about <i>le petit mort </i>and postcoital tristesse. I've got tristesse by the bucketful, but without any coitus.<br><br>My face as crimson as the buttocks of the spanked woman in the video, I drag my panties and jeans back into place and lie gasping in the chair. I scrabble for a tissue. I'm going to cry properly now, not just a few teardrops, and I know I should just run from the room, but somehow I just can't seem to move.<br><br>Something soft and folded is put gently into my hand, and as I steal a glance at it, I discover it's the marquess's immaculately laundered handkerchief. Still gulping and sniffing, I rub my face with it, breathing in the faint, mouthwatering fragrance of his cologne.<br><br>Shit, I fancy this man something rotten, and I've been fantasizing about him fancying me back, and falling for me, and now this has happened. I'm so embarrassed, I wish I could burrow into the leather upholstery and disappear out of sight.<br><br>A strong arm settles around my shoulders, and the great chair creaks as he sits down on the arm beside me.<br><br>"Hey, there's no harm done," the marquess says softly. "Now we both know each other's dirty little secrets." He squeezes my shoulders. "I get off spanking girls' bottoms and having them wriggling on my lap. And you get off watching videos of it and playing with yourself." He pauses, and I sense him smiling that slow, wicked smile again. "And quite beautifully, I must admit. Quite exquisitely..."<br><br>I beg your pardon?<br><br>Hell, I must have looked awful. Crude. Ungainly. Like a complete slapper.<br><br>I try to wriggle free, but he holds me. He even puts up a hand to gently stroke my hair. I still can't look at him, even though part of me really wants to.<br><br>"I'm so embarrassed. I'm so sorry. I had no business coming in here and prying into your private things."<br><br>One long finger strokes down the side of my face, slips under my chin and gently lifts it. Nervously, I open my eyes and look into his. They're large and dark and brown and merry, and I feel as if I'm drowning, but suddenly that's a good thing.<br><br>All the embarrassment and mortification disappears, just as if it were the rain puddles outside evaporating in the sun. Indeed, beyond the window, the sky outside is brightening.<br><br>Suddenly I see mischief and sex and a sense of adventure in those fabulous eyes, and I feel turned on again, and somehow scared, but not in a way that has anything to do with an awkward situation with my employer. It's a new feeling, and it's erotic, but so much more.<br><br>"Indeed you didn't. That was rather naughty of you." His face is perfectly impassive, almost stern, but those eyes, oh, those eyes&#x2014;they're mad with dangerous fun. "Do you think we should do something about that?"<br><br>I feel as if I'm about to cross a line. Jump off a cliff. Ford some peculiar kind of Rubicon. This is the chance of a lifetime, and I'm a perfect novice in the world portrayed in his video, but I understand him completely without any further hint or education.<br><br>"Um... yes, my lord."<br><br>Should I stand? Then kneel? Or curtsy or something? He's still sitting on the arm of the chair, a huge masculine presence because he's tall and broad-shouldered. Everything a man and a master should be.<br><br>I'm just about to stand, and I feel him just about to reach for me, when suddenly and shockingly his mobile rings, and he lets out a lurid curse.<br><br>"Ack, I must take this. Money stuff," he growls, and nods to me to mute the television as he flips open his phone.<br><br>I make as if to leave, but he catches me by the arm and makes me stand in front of him. With almost serpentine grace, he slides into the armchair and pulls me across his lap. Then, as he has a terse conversation that I don't think he's enjoying much, he explores the shape of my bottom through my jeans.<br><br>He doesn't slap or smack or hit. He just cruises his fingertips over the denim-clad surface, assessing my contours and the resilience of my flesh.<br><br>Slowly, slowly, as he gets slightly cross with someone on the other end of the line, he examines my cheeks, my thighs and then, without warning, squeezes my crotch. I let out a little yelp, and that's when he <i>does </i>hit.<br><br>It's just the softest warning tap...but it's electrifying. I almost come on the spot and I have to bite down on my lip to stifle my groans.<br><br>I start to wriggle and he cups my sex harder, from behind, pressing with his fingers. Pleasure flares again as my jeans's seam rubs my aching clit.<br><br>I'm biting the upholstery, squirming and kicking my legs and grabbing at his legs and his muscular thighs through his jeans. He rides my unruliness, his hand firm between my legs as he owns my sex like the lord and master he truly is.<br><br>Eventually his call is over, and I'm a wrung-out rag. He flings aside his phone and turns me over, then kisses me.<br><br>I expect domineering hunger and passion, but it's soft, light and sweet, almost a zephyr.<br><br>He wants me. He's hard, I can feel it beneath my bottom. But as if his own erection means nothing to him, he sets me on my feet then stands up beside me.<br><br>"Much as it pains me to leave so much undone and unsaid at this moment, Rose, I have to go." His eyes are dark. Is it lust? Regret? Something more complex? "I need to go to London, and I'm going to have to get a bloody taxi because I've just left my car at the garage." He pauses, then leans down to kiss me on the lips again, a little harder this time. "But when I get back, we'll reconvene. If that's agreeable?" He tilts his head to one side as he looks down on me, and his exquisite hair slides sideways like silk.<br><br>I nod and mutter something incomprehensible that doesn't make sense even to me, and then he pats me on the bottom again and strides away across the room.<br><br>At the door, he gives me a wink, his dark eyes twinkling with mischief.<br><br>"Enjoy the rest of the video," he says, then suddenly he's gone.</p><h2>Elgin Trench Watches of the Great War</h2><p>A combination of 440 photos and advertisements, plus informative text, tell the story of the Elgin National Watch Company wristwatches that accompanied U.S. Army troops into the trenches of Europe in World War I.

They have kids, husbands, jobs, and bills to pay. What makes them extraordinary is that each woman has awakened to her true nature. And while that sounds like enlightenment, it doesn't look like the old stereotype of transcendence, detachment, and bliss. Quite the contrary. This is the feminine half of the spiritual journey&#x2015;bringing it down to earth and embracing all of what it means to be human.</p><p>Like many of her generation, Rita Marie Robinson has been on a lifelong search. Innocently looking outside of herself for the answer, she explored many paths--from the occult to shamanism to Buddhism and New Thought Churches. Her work interests were equally eclectic--she worked as a radio journalist, in real estate sales and development, and finally as a psychotherapist. She received her Masters Degree in 1995 from Pacifica Graduate Institute, known for its archetypal and soul-centered approach to counseling. After the death of her husband in 1994, Rita trained as a Hospice volunteer and in Compassionate Care of the Dying with Joan Halifax. Rita has lived and worked in Santa Barbara, Santa Fe and Telluride, Colorado where she currently lives on a peaceful mountaintop with her husband, dog, and big garden.<i>Ordinary Women Extraordinary Wisdom </i> will become a milestone in female spirituality. Not only does it recount the fascinating and intimate stories of twelve "ordinary" women in their search for peace and self knowledge, the author engages the reader with her own quest for truth through her integrity, vulnerability and courage. Beautifully written with captivating honesty, this unique book will become an inspiration for both men and women alike, also looking for the essence of who they truly are. -- <i>Paula Marvelly, author of <i>Teachers of One</i></i><br><br>It is with tremendous enthusiasm that I recommend this book to you. It is an exquisite pointer to the vast field of women who have realized the highest spiritual truths and are speaking out to bring their wisdom to the table so that we may benefit from their labors of love. Rita Marie Robinson is a gifted writer. This is a visionary book to be cherished for the intimate glimpses it provides us into the lives of women who point the way to how we can live a life of enlightened living in the midst of ordinary circumstances. -- <i>Richard C. Miller PhD, author of <i>Yoga Nidra</i></i><br><br>One of those books to savor, underline like crazy, and then age with gracefully until its dog-eared pages no longer need to remind you that you're already Home. -- <i>Raphael Cushnir, author of How Now: <i>100 Ways to Celebrate the Present Moment</i></i><br><br>This is a book that gives us the permission to be ourselves, thesimple wonder of whom we really are.

This version aims to be different from other editions of the play. It invites you to bring the play to life in your classroom through enjoyable activities that will help increase your understanding. You are encourage to make up your own mind about the play, rather than have someone else&#39;s interpretation handed down to you. Whatever you do, remember that Shakespeare wrote his plays to be acted, watched and enjoyed.According to legend, Queen Elizabeth I was so delighted with the character of Sir John Falstaff in <i>Henry IV,</i> Parts I and II, that she commanded Shakespeare to create a romantic comedy depicting the jolly old rogue in love. The obedient playwright responded with <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor,</i> a lively and enduring farce that offers a humorous rebuff to lechery and hypocrisy.<br>Falstaff, whose greed and vanity overwhelm his good sense, determines to seduce a pair of well-to-do country housewives. The portly knight meets his match among the gentlewomen of Windsor, however, who counter his every stratagem with witty maneuvers of their own that expose Sir John's tomfoolery to public mirth. Familiar Shakespearean themes and devices&#x2014;romance, jealousy, disguises, and mistaken identities&#x2014;enrich the plot, along with a sparkling cast of supporting characters, including rival wooers, informers, and witty go-betweens.<br>Dover (2014) unabridged republication of a standard edition.<br>See every Dover book in print at<br><b>www.doverpublications.com</b></p><h2>Mrs. Roberto: Or the Widowy Worries of the Moosepath League</h2><p>Landing unexpectedly on the farm of the eccentric Fern family, jovial Tobias Walton finds his courtship of Phileda McCannon interrupted, while guileless Joseph Thumb enlists the aid of the Moosepath League to rescue a damsel in distress. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>Van Reid is the author of <i>Cordelia Underwood</i> (a <i>New York Times</i> 1998 Notable Book), <i>Mollie Peer</i>, <i>Daniel Plainway</i>, and <i>Peter Loon</i>.Reid returns with the fourth rousing installment in his series featuring the bumbling but well-intentioned members of the Moosepath League of Portland, Maine, circa 1897. Comic, ruefully romantic and ever so tongue-in-cheek, this genteel and entertaining if sometimes meandering farce once again chronicles the league's lighter-than-air antics. Though Chairman Tobias Walton has faithfully promised his fiancee, Miss Phileda McCannon, that he will "enter no intrigues, nor court unusual company" while she's out of town, he and his faithful assistant, Sundry Moss, can't help addressing the mystery of depressed Hercules, a pig once the very soul of Fern Farm. Meanwhile, a trio of Tobias's fellow Moosepathians-Joseph Thump, Christopher Eagleton and Matthew Ephram-engage in an adventure of their own. When they attend While She Waits in Silence, a play with a very intriguing second act, they become convinced that Mrs. Roberto, a celebrated Ascensionist (she parachutes from a hot-air balloon "in her attractive suit of tights"), must be rescued from some unknown peril. Soon, Thump's humble look-alike, Thaddeus Q. Spark (proprietor of the Faithful Mermaid), and Mailon Ring, a mysterious street urchin, are involved in this comedy of errors, which is further complicated by Fuzz Hadley and his vile gang. Reid has carved a niche for himself with his Victorian spoofs, redolent of New England and full of derring-do and old-fashioned romance, and he is in top form with this latest series entry.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Strine (Text Classics)</h2><p>What will become of the Cuban revolutoin With Fidel Castro&#39;s decline many outside Cuba have predicted the end of the revolution and a return to the US-dominated capitalism that prevailed on the island before 1959.

What, then, can a reassessment of this contentious first lady of American letters add to an understanding of the gay identities that have emerged in America over the past century? As Marilee Lindemann shows in this study of the novelist's life and work, Cather's sexual coming-of-age occurred at a time when a cultural transition was recasting love between women as sexual deviance rather than romantic friendship. At the same time, the very identity of "America" was characterized by great instability as the United States emerged as a modern industrial nation and imperial power. Indeed, both terms, "queer" and "America," achieved fresh ideological potency at the turn of the century. <i>Willa Cather: Queering America</i> is an enlightening unpacking of Cather's writings, from her controversial love letters of the 1890s--in which "queer" is employed to denote sexual deviance--to her epic novels, short stories, and critical writings. Lindemann points to the "queer" qualities of Cather's fiction--rebellion against traditional fictional form, with sometimes unlikable characters, lack of emphasis on heroic action, and lack of engagement in the drama of heterosexual desire.</p><p>An enlightening unpacking of Cather&#39;s writings, from her controversial love letters of the 1890s--in which &#34;queer&#34; is employed to denote sexual deviance--to her epic novels, short stories, and critical writings.Marilee Lindemann is assistant professor of English at the University of Maryland.

Marszalek is professor of history at Mississippi State University and the author of Court Martial: A Black Man in America and Sherman: A Soldier's Passion for Order.</p>From Marszalek (History/Mississippi State Univ.; Sherman, 1992, etc.), a vivid evocation of a dramatic episode that preoccupied and temporarily crippled the Jackson administration. More than 160 years before Paula Jones and Gennifer Flowers, America's first sex scandal, the Peggy Eaton affair (182931), rocked the White House. Newly elected Andrew Jackson was a controversial figure and no stranger to scandal; he'd killed a man in a duel, wedded another man's wife before her divorce was final, executed two British civilians in an extralegal military action in Florida, and massacred hundreds of Indian women and children in frontier battles. Marszalek shows how Jackson's frequent encounters with scandal had made him proud, rigid, and quick to take offense. His wife Rachel's death soon after the 1828 election, thought to have been brought about by the vicious attacks on her character, filled the grief-stricken Jackson with righteous anger, and when Washington gossips snubbed the vivacious young Peggy Eaton, wife of Jackson's secretary of war, Jackson vigorously sprang to her defense. Peggy, the widow of a navy purser who allegedly consorted with John Eaton while her husband was at sea and married him before the requisite mourning period expired, was thought to have low morals, although Marszalek argues that her real offenses were her low social origins and her unfeminine, ``forward'' behavior with men. What began as an act of social ostracism ultimately polarized the Jackson cabinet, resulted in a fatal estrangement between the president and vice president (Calhoun's wife led the ostracism of Peggy), and caused the resignation and reorganization of Jackson's cabinet, leaving the presidential aspirations of Calhoun a shambles and positioning Martin Van Buren to succeed Jackson. Marszalek's absorbing narrative illuminates how much, and how little, Washington and American society have changed: The small- mindedness and sexism of Washington's matrons, and the punctilious protectiveness of the president, would be inconceivable today, but the vicious nature of political rumormongering and scandal in Washington remains. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her vision holds out the difficult promise of a truly democratic American identity whose possibilities are no longer limited and disfigured by race.</p><p>"Scholarship, even when thorough, doesn't always enlighten. For that one needs the kind of surgical insight Grace Hale has applied to her impeccable research.

He lives in New York City.</p>Price (The Breaks, 1982, etc.) has spent the past ten years writing for Hollywood (Sea of Love, etc.)--but you wouldn't know it from the dense textures and supple dramatics of this epic slice of urban grit about frazzled drug-dealers and burnt-out cops. Of the many impeccably authentic urban types here, Price focuses on two: 20-ish ``Strike'' Dunham, black chief of a crew of crack-dealers (``clockers'') in the dead-end burg of Dempsy, N.J., and 43-year-old white Dempsy homicide cop Rocco Klein. Each is suffering an identity crisis when a murder puts them on a collision course. Strike, in a constant panic from dealing with his homicidal boss, crack-kingpin Rodney Little, is considering changing jobs; Rocco, six months from retirement, is thinking that his life is a big zero--a nullity underlined by his humiliating antics to curry the favor of a film star who might portray him in a movie. Then someone guns down another of Little's henchmen, and--shocking both Strike and Rocco--Strike's solid-citizen older brother, Victor, confesses to the killing: ``self-defense,'' he claims. Not so, thinks Rocco, who decides that Victor is covering for Strike and starts harassing the young dealer by framing him as a stoolie- -certain death at Little's hands. Meanwhile, myriad subplots vivify Strike's and Rocco's worlds: Rocco initiates the film star into the horrors of jail-life; Strike apprentices a young boy into dealing; Rocco's baby girl disappears; Little's legendary hit man wastes away from AIDS; Strike nearly dies from a bleeding ulcer. Finally, Strike, with a vengeful Little literally steps behind, turns to Rocco for help--a move that allows both to find a kind of hope and renewal. A vital and bold novel rich in unexpected pleasure, with Price generally avoiding melodrama, sentimentality, and stereotype to portray a harsh world with cleareyed compassion.

David Logan (the father in Taylor's 1977 Newbery Award winner, <i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i>) tells a story of his boyhood in rural Mississippi at a time when "uppity niggers" can be hanged for thinking themselves equal to whites and the horror of slavery still haunts his mother's memory. The Logans are among the few black families to own land, and during a prolonged drought, they have a well of sweet water, which they share with their neighbors, black and white. Most people are grateful, but the white Simms family hates being beholden to blacks. The tense confrontation erupts in beatings and terror. The cast is large for so short a novel--it's hard sometimes to keep track of all the people in the community--but the Logan family is beautifully individualized. David is able to heed his father's warning, "Use your head, not your fists," but David's hotheaded older brother can't bear the constant humiliation. The well of the title is also a metaphor for the history of the place: both the bigotry that lies beneath the surface and the sweet strength of family ties. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Devoted</h2><p>Bound by a shared determination to save their people from Viking conquerors, Elin, a mistress of the forbidden powers, and Owen, a warrior-bishop, discover a burning love for each other. Reprint.</p><p>Do not pity Alice Borchardt. Her sister, Anne Rice, may be immensely better known, but Borchardt, the older sister, is Rice's equal in presenting lush otherworlds balanced with historical detail. Indeed, Rice, in an introduction to <i>Devoted</i>, cites Borchardt as an inspiration for her own fiction and an early collaborator in imaginative excess. Like the Bront�s before them, the sisters' childhood was spent sharing a dream world peopled with heroes, heroines, pirates, and aliens.<p> As a first work, <i>Devoted</i> may presage the author's potential. It reads as though she were shaking the tree of her imagination to see what will drop. One story can hardly contain all the fruitful ideas that fall. Set in the year 900, the story centers on a medieval stronghold beset by invading Vikings, corrupt feudal landlords, and a traitor within. Owen, Bishop of Chantalon, is a Christian; Elin, beaten, raped, and forced into slavery by the Vikings, is of the Forest People, pagans with magical skills. Through their union, Borchardt explores the conflict between paganism and early Christianity and the flagrant inequalities between men and women, the nobility and the lesser born, and people with different beliefs. These large themes make the story overlong, sometimes threatening to take it over. But the monumental, blood-soaked clashes between the Saxons and the Vikings; the descriptions of household artifacts, weaponry, and fashion in the Middle Ages; and, of course, the heart of the tale: the love that is hammered into being like a coat of woven mail between Owen and Elin, make this first novel a worthwhile read. <i>--Brenda Pittsley</i></p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Known as Abolition House, Mrs. Sprigg&#x2019;s hosted lively dinner-table debates of antislavery politics by the congressional boarders. The unusually rapid turnover in the enslaved staff suggested that there were frequent escapes north to freedom from Abolition House, likely a cog in the underground railroad. These early years in Washington proved formative for Lincoln. <p>In 1861, now in the White House, Lincoln could gaze out his office window and see the Confederate flag flying across the Potomac. Washington, DC, sat on the front lines of the Civil War. Vulnerable and insecure, the capital was rife with Confederate sympathizers. On the crossroads of slavery and freedom, the city was a refuge for thousands of contraband and fugitive slaves. The Lincoln administration took strict measures to tighten security and established camps to provide food, shelter, and medical care for contrabands. In 1863, a Freedman&#x2019;s Village rose on the grounds of the Lee estate, where the Confederate flag once flew.</p><p>The president and Mrs. Lincoln personally comforted the wounded troops who flooded wartime Washington. In 1862, Lincoln spent July 4 riding in a train of ambulances carrying casualties from the Peninsula Campaign to Washington hospitals. He saluted the &#x201c;One-Legged Brigade&#x201d; assembled outside the White House as &#x201c;orators,&#x201d; their wounds eloquent expressions of sacrifice and dedication. The administration built more than one hundred military hospitals to care for Union casualties.</p><p>These are among the unforgettable scenes in <em>Lincoln&#x2019;s Citadel</em>, a fresh, absorbing narrative history of Lincoln&#x2019;s leadership in Civil War Washington. Here is the vivid story of how the Lincoln administration met the immense challenges the war posed to the city, transforming a vulnerable capital into a bastion for the Union.</p> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Kenneth J.

Ray and his wife, Michelle, have two kids.Offering a combination of evolution and paleontology with a large dose of extinction, the authors state that "650 million years ago, give or take a few million years, the sea was mother and father to us all" and that we all have a vertebrate in common from the Pikaia, a walking fish. They thus poke some fun at both creationists and evolutionists.

To a twelve-year-old, the U.S. Marshal's arrival came in the form of an unfathomable explosion that would haunt his dreams into adulthood. Two local police officers and one marshal from the housing department had been dispatched to evict a poor and hungry family of thirteen -- despite the fact that Christmas was less than one week away.</p><p>My father lay huddled with his six brothers, all forced to survive in one room, on two mattresses, in the musty three-room apartment. It was in the dead of winter and none of the Gotti children -- seven boys and four girls, ages five to sixteen -- had clothing suitable for protection against the elements. Dad would later recall that evening as being not only unbearably cold but accompanied by a dark, empty sky.</p><p>The Gotti children were accustomed to sharing tight quarters. If it seemed unnatural, even cruel, it was nonetheless preferable to sleeping on a cold bare floor "or being homeless," as my father used to say. The family bounced around in those years, from a poverty-stricken section of the South Bronx to a modest apartment in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. My grandfather, John Senior, made some money in an all-night card game and moved the family into a middle-class neighborhood; however, it wasn't long before his luck (and money) ran out. Within a few months the Gotti clan ended up in more humble surroundings, a shabby apartment in Downtown Brooklyn. "Times were hard," my father said. "And they were about to get a lot harder."</p><p>The eviction in 1952 was swift and heartless. Dressed only in worn flimsy garments, the Gotti children and their mother, Fannie, stood shivering in front of the dilapidated apartment complex that only a few minutes earlier had been their home. John Senior was out that night, off on one of his business trips. Monthly rent on the apartment was a paltry sum, but even that proved more than my grandfather could manage.</p><p>Philomena "Fannie" DeCarlo Gotti was a hardworking housewife who often took on odd jobs outside the home -- doing the neighbors' laundry, cleaning apartments, bagging groceries at a local market to help make ends meet. But lately there never seemed to be enough money. The family was barely able to keep food on the table and heat in the apartment. Conversely, my grandfather, John Joseph Gotti, was a perpetual adolescent, forever in search of excitement and fun. An avid gambler, drinker, and womanizer, he rarely held a steady job; whenever he got the "itch," as Grandma called it, he would take off for parts unknown, typically accompanied by some barmaid he'd only recently met.</p><p>There were times when Grandpa hit the road on one of his socalled "business trips" and didn't return for months. For a while he had a job as a camera grip for a major film studio and even traveled to Hollywood on one occasion. This failed to result in any sort of legitimate career, but it did produce a handful of entertaining tales. My grandfather was fond of embellishment, and so he would tell anyone within earshot of his work-related war stories, like the time he met Jane Russell.</p><p>During the filming of <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>, Grandpa swore the gorgeous actress was attracted to him (forget for a moment the professional chasm that separated the lowly tech and the leading lady), and that she looked for excuses to talk to him. According to his story, she even winked at him on occasion.</p><p>Then there was the time he met Tony Curtis at the studio commissary. Grandpa insisted the two had become fast friends.</p><p>"That guy is a class act," Grandpa had often said. Then he would smile and laugh. "Very personable, too."</p><p>So instantaneous was their bond that Grandpa and Tony Curtis went out together that very night and took the town by storm. They drank themselves blind, eventually winding up in a seedy motel with a "couple of real lookers." Or so Grandpa claimed, anyway.</p><p>The odd brush with greatness apparently was far more important to my grandfather than the mundane responsibilities of family life. It seemed not to matter that he had a large family to feed, or that there was never enough money to pay the rent or heating bill. And every so often, the Gotti family was kicked to the curb.</p><p>This naturally produced a degree of cynicism in my father, who years later would erupt any time he read a clich�-ridden newspaper article or book that described Grandpa as a hardworking Italian immigrant.</p><p>"These fuckin' bums that write books -- they're worse than us," he would rail. "Lies. All lies! My father was born in New Jersey. He's never been to Italy in his whole fuckin' life. He never worked a day in his life. He was a rolling stone. He never provided for his family. He never did nothin'. He never earned nothin'. And we never had nothin'."</p><p>Dad recalled his mother's reaction while standing at the curb on the night of the eviction, in the freezing cold, wearing a tattered sweater over a worn and faded housedress. She was only in her mid-thirties, but looked closer to fifty. The years, overloading her with work and anxiety and neglect, had not been kind to her. Grandma was a "cold woman," Dad often said, hardened by years of sacrifice and disappointment. Mostly, Dad blamed his father for this. A man was supposed to take care of his family: put a roof over their heads, food in their bellies, and keep them warm in proper winter clothing. But, rather than struggle to fulfill his responsibilities and obligations, Grandpa chose instead to run -- usually to the nearest bar to drown himself in his failure as a husband and father.</p><p>On this evening my father saw that she was understandably upset. Although Grandma rarely showed weakness in front of her children, the tears streamed down her cheeks. She stared at the old apartment building, then out at the street, and then back to the apartment building. Her eyes, my father noticed, were empty and sad, and the expression on her face frightened him.</p><p>The Gotti clan stood shivering outside for nearly an hour that night, a mid-winter drizzle chilling them to the bone. "An hour," Dad said. "But it felt like an eternity."</p><p>Exhausted and fearing for the welfare of her children, Grandma finally took action, marching the entire, rain-soaked clan nearly a mile through the streets of Brooklyn to the House of the Good Shepherd, a church-sponsored residence for "wayward girls" (the facility catered to young, single women who had unplanned pregnancies). It must have been painful for Grandma to beg -- she was a proud woman, after all -- but that is what she did. For the sake of her children, she asked for mercy, and Sister Mary Margaret, dressed head-to-toe in black, responded with kindness, showing Grandma and the Gotti children to the building's attic.</p><p>In reality, it wasn't really an attic at all; it was a four-room apartment, a conversion made in the early 1940s to accommodate housing needs for the staff. Although the apartment had only an efficiency kitchenette, it was better than nothing, and Grandma saw its potential. The living room was really more of an alcove, adjacent to the kitchenette; it would likely serve as a fourth bedroom for the oldest male children. The two other rooms would be shared by Grandma and the remaining children, including my father, at least until Grandpa could find his way to the family's new home. No one knew when that would be, but at that point, one of the three bedrooms would then be used as a master, resulting in eleven children sharing two small rooms. Tight quarters, to be sure, but, as Dad explained, "It was definitely better than the alternative."</p><p>The days that followed would prove nearly as bleak. At the age of twelve, Dad was forced to hit the streets and find work, as were the other Gotti children. Everyone was expected to pull their own weight, especially the boys.</p><p>Dad combed the neighborhood looking for employment. Options, he quickly learned, were limited. A corner service station on Fulton Street had recently dismissed two mechanics in an effort to cut costs. A local deli already had two full-time day workers and three part-time night staffers. The manager at the A&amp;P supermarket offered little encouragement, telling Dad he was too young for anything but carrying bags for customers. My father gave that one a moment's consideration before spotting a crowd of eager boys fighting over customers in the parking lot. Realizing that his pay would consist only of tips, and that the store already seemed overstaffed, he walked away.</p><p>Not enough customers, not enough hours, not enough money.</p><p>Six weeks later, my grandfather ambled down the street to the House of the Good Shepherd, having easily tracked the family down through a network of friends and acquaintances. Along the way, he'd been told of the eviction and the dire circumstances faced by those whom he had abandoned. If his father felt guilt or remorse, Dad said, it wasn't readily apparent. Accountability was not high on Grandpa's list of virtues. He preferred to play the victim, forever damning the world and cursing God for having dealt him a raw hand. And so he rationalized his behavior and his vices -- the alcohol, gambling, loose women, and the nasty temper as well.</p><p>Grandpa turned up at the attic apartment late one night, itching for an argument with my grandmother. At first he rang the bell and waited patiently, but there was no answer. After three tries, he began pounding the door like an impulsive child -- pounding and kicking with such force that Sister Mary Margaret nearly called the police. Realizing who the belligerent man was she told him, "Please, sir. Use the top bell."</p><p>Meanwhile, oblivious to the commotion three stories below, my grandmother and her brood slept peacefully. Of all the Gotti children, only two were awake. Dad was restless and couldn't sleep, and one of his younger brothers, I believe Ritchie, was wide awake because he had to go to the bathroom. Since there were seven boys in a single room, and only two beds for them to share, the Gotti...</p></p><h2>The Narnia Code: C.S Lewis and the Secret of the Seven Heavens</h2><p>Light wear to cover.

Surprisingly, however, Jewish identity remains one of the least explored terrains in contemporary discussions of multiculturalism and identity-based art. <i>Too Jewish?</i>&nbsp; takes a fresh, often confrontational and sometimes humorous, approach to newly considered representations of Jewish identity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>This book, accompanied by a major exhibition at The Jewish Museum, New York, places the Jewish identity subjects in the recent art of such artists as Deborah Kass, Rona Pondick, Archie Rand, Elaine Reichek, Art Spiegelman, Hannah Wilke, and others within a larger continuum of influences ranging from nineteenth-century art history to twentieth-century media and pop culture. Essays by major writers explore the historic and scientific roots of the construction of the Jew's "otherness,&#x201d; assimilation strategies, and stereotypes inherent in past and present definitions of Jewish masculinity and femininity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>The contributors include cultural critic <b>Maurice Berger,</b> sociologist <b>Sander L.

This is a lively and provocative book that offers a unique critical perspective on Jewish identity, multiculturalism, or contemporary art.</p></p><p>In this companion volume to a major exhibition currently on display at the Jewish Museum of New York, artists, including Deborah Kass, Rona Pondick, Archie Rand, Art Spiegelman, and Hannah Wilke explore Jewish identity through contemporary art and pop culture. The illustrations are thought-provoking, sometimes quite humorous, and usually very off-beat. The illustrations aim to make the viewer uncomfortable enough to reflect on identity. Like any minority, American Jews have never felt completely at peace in the host culture. They have often used humor to deal with the conflicts and pressures involved in conforming to the dominant norm. Editor and curator Kleeblatt also offers incisive essays by cultural critic Maurice Berger, sociologist Sander Gilman, playwright Tony Kushner, and other major voices about being Jewish today. The book is ably produced with a clean, easy-to-read layout. There are copious notes and bibliographies after each essay to point the way for readers interested in further research.

In fact, state-sponsored chapel services were commonplace until the World War II era, and as late as the 1950s, it was not unusual for leading schools to refer to themselves as "Christian" institutions. Today, the once pervasive influence of religion in the intellectual and cultural life of America's preeminent colleges and universities has all but vanished. In <em>The Soul of the American University</em>, Marsden explores how, and why, these dramatic changes occurred.<br> Far from a lament for a lost golden age when mainline Protestants ruled American education, <em>The Soul of the American University</em> offers a penetrating critique of that era, surveying the role of Protestantism in higher education from the founding of Harvard in the 1630s through the collapse of the WASP establishment in the 1960s. Marsden tells the stories of many of our pace-setting universities at defining moments in their histories, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the University of Michigan, Johns Hopkins, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. He recreates the religious feuds that accompanied Yale's transition from a flagship evangelical college to a university, and the dramatic debate over the place of religion in higher education between Harvard's President Charles Eliot and Princeton's President James McCosh. Marsden's analysis ranges from debates over Darwinism and higher critics of the Bible, to the roles of government and wealthy contributors, the impact of changing student mores, and even the religious functions of college football. He argues persuasively that the values of "liberalism" and "tolerance" that the establishment championed and used to marginalize Christian fundamentalism and Roman Catholicism eventually and perhaps inevitably led to its own disappearance from the educational milieu, as nonsectarian came to mean exclusively secular.<br> While the largely voluntary disestablishment of religion may appear in many respects commendable, Marsden believes that it has nonetheless led to the infringement of the free exercise of religion in most of academic life. In effect, nonbelief has been established as the only valid academic perspective. In a provocative final chapter, Marsden spells out his own prescription for change, arguing that just as the academy has made room for feminist and multicultural perspectives, so should there be room once again for traditional religious viewpoints. A thoughtful blend of historical narrative and searching analysis, <em>The Soul of the American University</em> exemplifies what it advocates: that religious perspectives can provide a legitimate contribution to the highest level of scholarship.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:R</em><br> <strong>George M. Marsden</strong> is Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History at the University of Notre Dame. His many books include <em>Fundamentalism and American Culture</em>, <em>The Secularization of the Academy</em> (edited with Bradley J. Longfield), and <em>Understanding Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism</em>.<br>"Marsden, a history professor at the University of Notre Dame, writes well and possesses a masterly command of both the historical terrain and the intellectual issues of his subject...The relation between institutional religion and academe is an important subject, and Marsden has written an<br>essential guide to what he rightly calls the 'moral crisis' of the modern university."--New York Newsday<br><br>"Marsden calls for a return of religious perspectives to the university discourse. But he does not glamorize the previously close relationship between religion and education....Marsden makes a strong argument for the academy to come full circle and once again welcome religious<br>perspectives."--The Christian Science Monitor<br><br>"Marsden's point is not to argue for restoration of Christian hegemony in university life, but to show how the disappearance of lively religious debate has left a vacuum at the heart of university life. He argues that a more meaningful commitment to pluralism would produce healthy debate,<br>including views informed by faith....Even [this book's] sharpest critics will find it hard to ignore. Meticulous research, cogent arguments and radical reframing of current debate make this book a valuable contribution to discussion of the university's role in American life."--The Washington<br>Post<br><br>"First-rate historical analysis...a compelling argument for giving God a voice on campus."--Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"Argues that just as the academy has introduced alternative curricula...it should again consider making room for traditional religious viewpoints that can provide a legitimate contribution to the highest level of scholarship."--Library Journal<br><br>"This book will depress some and enrage others. Everyone should read it. Marsden demonstrates clearly how far American higher education has moved from its roots in the Protestant establishment. If we are to regain a moral vision for our colleges and universities, we must come to terms with<br>this critical dimension of our past."--Robert Wuthnow, author of Christianity in the 21st Century<br><br>"A national debate currently rages about the role of religion in higher education and in public intellectual life more generally. The Soul of the American University is indispensable reading in that debate. Grounded in serious historical research, argued with clear-headed passion, George<br>Marsden's book will raise hackles. More importantly, it raises crucial--and now unavoidable--questions."--James Turner, University of Michigan<br><br>"Comprehensively researched and lucidly narrated....Mr. Marsden's timely book serves as an indispensable backdrop to a debate raging today. Does America need a common set of values to assure its historical identity?"--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"[Marsden's] historical narrative can be read with profit both by those who welcome and by those who fear a greater role for religion in higher education."--Lingua Franca</p><h2>Stuka Pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel (Schiffer Military History)</h2><p>The life story of the highest decorated soldier of the Wehrmacht.

If affects not only the body but also the spirit and soul. Illness is about life and death, fear and hope, love and conflict, spirit and body. And yet, the healthcare system is not structured around these considerations&#x2014;our doctors and other medical professionals are not trained to deal with the whole person.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Care of the Soul In Medicine&nbsp;</i>is Moore&#x2019;s manifesto about the future of healthcare. In this new vision of care, Moore speaks to the importance of healing a person rather than simply treating a body. He gives advice to both healthcare providers and patients for maintaining dignity and humanity. He provides spiritual guidance for dealing with feelings of mortality and threat, encouraging patients to not only take an active part in healing but also to view illness as a positive passage to new awareness. While we don&#x2019;t fully understand the extent to which healing depends on attitude; it has been shown that healing needs to focus on more than the body.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The future of medicine is not only in new technical developments and research discoveries; it is also in appreciating the state of soul and spirit in illness.</p></p><p><p>Best-selling author and psychotherapist <b>Thomas Moore </b>has written numerous books on spirituality, including<i> Writing in the Sand,</i> S<i>oul Mates, Life at Work, </i>and the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Care of the Soul</i>. Born in Detroit, Michigan, to an Irish Catholic family, Moore devoted his life to the study of theology, world religions, Jungian and archetypal psychology, the history of art, and world mythology. He currently lives in New Hampshire.</p>In his latest volume on everyday upkeep of the soul, psychotherapist/theologist and prolific author Moore (Care of the Soul, Soul Mates, Dark Knights of the Soul) looks at the ways that health care addresses the spirit and soul--with body, the three distinct aspects of the human condition--and the how it can do so better. Addressing providers and patients, Moore gives readers ways to tell if a doctor works with his soul, explaining why a good bedside manner--a sense of connection, a willingness to take off the mask--is a vital characteristic of an effective healer, but also addresses topics like a provider's sense of calling, spiritual meaning, the relevance of emotional and personality issues, and the physical environment itself. An understanding of often-unconscious factors he calls "emotional complexes" is key, and Moore takes readers through his concepts with an insightful and accessible voice, offering much reassurance and love as he goes. Citing his extensive scholarly background and his own experience with doctors, Moore challenges the modern notion of dispassionate and highly regimented health care, offering practical and conceptually simple ideas to incorporate awareness of "soul" into the health care equation. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Donald Tyson presents a new, easy way to perform ritual magic with only one tool: tarot. From manipulating elemental forces of nature to making potent charms, all ceremonial rituals can be performed with a standard 78-card deck. <br> <br>Tyson's efficient system of tarot magic is based on the Golden Dawn tradition, which corresponds with tarot imagery. He teaches how to work magic on the astral level by projecting one's awareness into the ritual tarot layout. Learn how to set up an astral temple, build an altar, cast a magic circle, and create a triangle through which to actualize your purpose. This innovative guide to tarot magic also includes rituals related to unions, business, banishing, and evoking elementals.</p></p><p><p><strong>Donald Tyson</strong> (Nova Scotia, Canada) is an occult scholar and the author of the popular, critically acclaimed Necronomicon series. He has written more than a dozen books on Western esoteric traditions.</p><i>1 <br></i><b>What Is Tarot Magic? <br> <br></b>When you think of the Tarot, you probably think of fortune telling. <br>This is not surprising since divination has been the main function <br>of Tarot cards for more than two hundred years. Only in the <br>late eighteenth century did the symbolism on the cards acquire a <br>higher spiritual meaning and come to be regarded as an important <br>part of the Western esoteric tradition. In spite of its elevation from <br>the mundane to the mysterious, the primary use for the Tarot remains <br>fortune telling even in the present day. If you examine the <br>books available on the Tarot, most are about divination, with only a <br>handful devoted to the higher meaning of Tarot symbolism. <br> <br>There is another side to the Tarot that is little known and less <br>understood. The cards can be used as potent instruments of ritual <br>magic. This active function of the Tarot has always existed, but is <br>overlooked or ignored even by many of the greatest modern ceremonial <br>magicians, who regard the Tarot either as an instrument <br>of fortune telling or as a source of symbolism suitable for meditation. <br>It is much more, as this book will show. <br> <br>A deck of Tarot cards contains everything you need to work a <br>complete and effective system of ritual magic. With the cards alone, <br>you can construct an astral temple, build an altar, cast a magic circle, <br>create a triangle through which to actualize your purpose, manipulate <br>the blind elemental forces of nature, communicate with <br>other people and with spirits, cleanse atmospheres and places of <br>destructive influences, make potent charms, extend aid, and perform <br>works of healing. You can attract wealth, gain love, or achieve <br>victory over your enemies. You can use the Tarot to accomplish any <br>purpose you would seek to achieve through more cumbersome <br>and complex methods of ceremonial magic. <br> <br>All this with only a deck of Tarot cards. When your work is done, <br>you simply fold the cards together and put your temple, your altar, <br>your circle, your triangle, and all your instruments into your <br>pocket, ready for the next time you need them. Tarot magic requires <br>no expensive materials or hand-crafted tools, no incense, no <br>candles, no oils, no arcane languages, no special place in which to <br>work, no costly robes or talismans. Yet it is as effective as the most <br>complex system of magic. Everything is done through the symbolism <br>of the cards, in accord with the esoteric correspondences for <br>the Tarot set forth by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. <br> <br>The standard Golden Dawn correspondences for the Tarot are <br>used throughout this book because they are the most widely understood <br>and accepted. Those familiar with my other writings know <br>that I have made modifications to these correspondences in my <br>personal esoteric system, but in this general text on Tarot magic I <br>prefer to retain the correspondences with which most readers will <br>be familiar in order to minimize confusion. It is a simple matter <br>to adapt Tarot magic to match any set of occult correspondences. <br>That is part of its versatility&#x2015;the cards are moveable and may be <br>set in any desired arrangement. Those interested in my modifications <br>to the Tarot correspondences will find them explained in the <br>appendix. <br> <br>For many years, I used Tarot magic as part of my own ritual work <br>but did not teach it, or even reduce it to a separate integrated system. <br>In several of my books, I mention it briefly as a subject worth <br>the consideration of serious readers. For example, in my first book, <br><i>The New Magus</i>, published in 1988, I wrote: &#x201c;The uses of the Tarot <br>in magic are too many to list. Each individual card can be the ob- <br>ject of fruitful meditations. Cards can be used as talismans, as instruments <br>of ritual workings, as patterns for godforms, and as symbols <br>of power. Above all else, the Tarot is a tool for examining the <br>Self and its relation to life&#x201d; (Tyson, 183). <br> <br>Little did I imagine when I wrote those words that it would be <br>nearly two decades before I would find an opportunity to present <br>the system of Tarot magic that I was then developing and using in <br>my own rituals. Here for the first time, that system is revealed in full <br>detail and in a unified format. Those who master it will find that it <br>frees them from the burden of the complex physical apparatus of <br>traditional ceremonial occultism. I have deliberately restricted the <br>system described here to the cards themselves and only the cards. <br>The goal is simplicity. The Tarot is a symbolic model of the universe. <br>Nothing external to it is required. <br> <br>Traditional magic relies on symbolism also, but in its often complex <br>and ornate ceremonies these symbols are embodied by physical <br>objects and instruments. For example, the magic circle is a protective <br>shield or barrier that is physically marked or laid out on the <br>floor or ground where the ritual is worked. It is well understood by <br>those skilled in ritual that there is another intangible circle that exists <br>on the astral level in the mind of the magician, without which <br>the physical circle would be powerless. The circle held in the imagination <br>is the living soul of the magic circle, and the physical circle <br>laid out or marked on the floor serves as its body. <br> <br>It is possible to represent the astral realities of ritual magic with <br>symbolic rather than physical instruments. An astral circle can be <br>grounded or given a body by means of a group of Tarot cards just <br>as effectively as it is grounded by a circle drawn in chalk on the <br>floor. In both cases, it is the circle in the imagination of the magician <br>that is the true working circle of the ritual, but in traditional <br>magic it is fixed in the form of a circle drawn, painted, or otherwise <br>marked on the floor, whereas in Tarot magic it is fixed by means of <br>an arrangement of cards that embodies the ritual circle in its set of <br>esoteric correspondences. <br> <br>Nor is it necessary to lay the cards out in a large circle within <br>which the magician stands and works. This is one possible use for <br>the cards. I have myself employed it in rituals and it can be effective, <br>but to think only in these terms limits the versatility of Tarot <br>magic. Just as a group of cards can represent the true magic circle <br>on the astral level, so can a single card, carefully chosen, represent <br>and embody the magician. The ring of cards defining the circle <br>need then be only large enough to contain the card of the magician <br>and any other symbolic tools used in the circle. This allows <br>Tarot magic to be worked on a tabletop or similar convenient surface. <br>A ritual chamber is unnecessary because the deck of cards <br>becomes the ritual chamber. <br> <br>It may seem strange that the magician enters one of the cards <br>during rituals of Tarot magic. In the Western esoteric tradition, it is <br>usual for the magician to remain within his or her own body during <br>the greater part of ritual work. This is not equally so in the magic <br>of the East. Tibetan magicians work with esoteric designs laid out <br>upon the floor or the ground that express in symbolic form astral <br>temples, astral landscapes, or entire planes of being without physical <br>reality. They project themselves into these pictures by identifying <br>themselves with a small token, which they place within the design, <br>usually at its center. As long as the token that embodies their <br>identity remains within the design, they are present and self-aware <br>in the astral reality that the design represents. <br> <br>The technique of projecting the point of view, or self-awareness, <br>outside the body requires practice, but such projection is an <br>established part of Western magic as well. It is used for a variety <br>of purposes, such as projecting the self-awareness through an astral <br>doorway during scrying or soul flight, or into a godform when <br>invoking a higher spiritual being. It is a technique every person <br>serious about magic must learn sooner or later, and it is not very <br>difficult. Any beginner can project his or her self-awareness to a <br>limited and partial degree, although full perfection of the technique <br>requires months or years of practice. A virtue of Tarot magic <br>is that it can be worked with success even if the projection of the <br>point of view into a card is less than perfect. <br> <br>This system does not require the purchase of a special Tarot deck. <br>Any Tarot of seventy-eight cards will be effective. The occult correspondences <br>of the Golden Dawn upon which the entire system is <br>based are independent of the details of the card images, so the differences <br>between the Rider-Waite deck and the Crowley Thoth deck, <br>for example, do not determine the success of the magic worked. The <br>magic is not in the cards, which are merely tools used to construct <br>rituals and to represent various instruments and forces. The magic <br>is in the person using them. The cards act to focus and project the <br>power of the mind. <br> <br>Decks of smaller cards produce a more manageable ritual layout, <br>and are to be preferred in Tarot magic. In my own work, I use <br>the miniature Rider-Waite deck because it can be laid out on a very <br>limited surface area such as a desktop or end table. The size of the <br>cards has no effect on the potency of the magic. <br> <br>Whichever Tarot deck you select for your own rituals, you should <br>continue to use it until you become completely familiar with its <br>symbolism. Over time, a deck of Tarot cards used repeatedly for ritual <br>magic will acquire its own energies that make it easier to work <br>rituals with that deck. That is because the deck becomes more <br>real on the astral level within the mind of the magician using the <br>cards. Less effort is needed each time by the magician to create the <br>cards on the astral level, freeing up energies for the actual work of <br>magic. <br> <br>It is best to keep the deck of cards employed in ritual magic <br>separate and wrapped in a square of linen or some other natural <br>cloth, in order to preserve this useful quality of a sustained astral <br>charge. The cards should not be handled by others, or even shown <br>to them. A ritual is a very private activity, unless it is specifically <br>designed to be worked by a group. The tools of ritual are not for <br>curious eyes&#x2015;the system presented here is intended for the solitary <br>practitioner. Keep the deck separate and use it only for Tarot <br>magic. If you do divination, it is best to get a second deck of cards <br>for that purpose. <br> <br>Even those who use the Tarot strictly for telling fortunes and <br>have no interest in practical magic will find the explanations for <br>the Golden Dawn Tarot correspondences and their origins more <br>illuminating than any treatment of this subject that has previously <br>appeared in print. For some reason that is not obvious, unless it <br>is mere ignorance on the part of writers, the origin of the Golden <br>Dawn correspondences is seldom adequately explained, though <br>this set of correspondences forms the heart of the modern Tarot. <br>Diviners accept the correspondences without knowing their ultimate <br>source. A full awareness of how the correspondences came <br>to be can enhance the accurate use of the cards for prediction. <br> <br>This work is solely concerned with practical magic. It is not <br>about using the cards for divination, although this is a fascinating <br>and perfectly valid use for the Tarot. There are thousands of books <br>on fortune telling with the cards, and anyone who seeks to learn to <br>divine will have no trouble finding them. Here, you will discover <br>what is infinitely more rare and precious: a way to use the Tarot ritually <br>to cause active and potent change in the world in conformity <br>with your will. That is the very heart and soul of magic. <br> <br></p><h2>The Jungle</h2><p>The Jungle Book (1894) is a collection of stories written by Rudyard Kipling.The tales in the book (and also those in The Second Jungle Book which followed in 1895, and which includes five further stories about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. The verses of The Law of the Jungle, for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals, families and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or "heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle." The Jungle Book (1894) is a collection of stories written by Rudyard Kipling.The tales in the book (and also those in The Second Jungle Book which followed in 1895, and which includes five further stories about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. The verses of The Law of the Jungle, for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals, families and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or "heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle." Joseph Rudyard Kipling (December 30, 1865 &#x2013; January 18, 1936) was an English author and poet, born in India, and best known today for his children's books, including The Jungle Book (1894), The Second Jungle Book (1895), Just So Stories (1902), and Puck of Pook's Hill (1906); his novel, Kim (1901); his poems, including Mandalay (1890), Gunga Din (1890), and "If&#x2014;" (1910); and his many short stories, including "The Man Who Would Be King" (1888) and the collections Life's Handicap (1891), The Day's Work (1898), and Plain Tales from the Hills (1888). He is regarded as a major "innovator in the art of the short story"; his children's books are enduring classics of children's literature; and his best work speaks to a versatile and luminous narrative gift. Kipling was one of the most popular writers in English, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The author Henry James famously said of him: "Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known." In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English language writer to receive the prize, and he remains today its youngest-ever recipient. Among other honours, he was sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, all of which he rejected. However, later in life Kipling also came to be seen (in George Orwell's words) as a "prophet of British imperialism." Many saw prejudice and militarism in his works, and the resulting controversy about him continued for much of the 20th century. According to critic Douglas Kerr: "He is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognized as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced. That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with."

He lives with his wife, Heath, on a small farm near Collingwood, OntarioThere&#x2019;s a lot to read in a weekly newspaper. At first bounce, you wouldn&#x2019;t think there was anything much to say about a town like Larkspur. And yet my staff and I manage to squeeze ten thousand words a week into every issue of the <i>Free Press and Economist</i>. Forty thousand words a month. About eight fair-sized novels every year, I guess.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, you couldn&#x2019;t find anyone to publish novels like this. That&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;re dealing with the public side of life in the community; only those sanded and polished and varnished facts that can be printed safely without leading to anything more controversial than a brick through the front office window. Nothing is said about the darker side of Larkspur life . . . although we look hopefully every week in the police report. No. You have to go to the city papers for the juicy stuff. Nowhere in this slag-heap of words will you find the Larkspur resident unclothed, so to speak . . . although I see the Turnip Festival Queen sure made a stab at it this week.<br>&nbsp;<br>The closest we come, I suppose, would be Walt Wingfield and his Letters from Wingfield Farm. Generally speaking, if you asked my advice on how to run a weekly newspaper I&#x2019;d say avoid unsolicited contributions. Every crackpot within fifteen miles wants to get something in the paper. But in my case, some of my best material came to me just that way. Walt Wingfield is an ex&#x2013;chairman-of-the-board&#x2013;turned&#x2013; farmer. He used to be chairman and chief executive officer of MacFeeters, Bartlett and Hendrie . . . the big brokerage house down on Bay Street. Well, one day about a year ago, he gave up his six-figure income and bought a hundred acre farm out on the Seventh Concession of Persephone Township. He said he wanted to make a stand, to simplify his life.<br>&nbsp;<br>He&#x2019;d taken on a tough job. If you look at a climate-and soil map for this part of Southern Ontario you&#x2019;ll see a small circular zone marked &#x201c;4a.&#x201d; That is Persephone Township. &#x201c;Pursefoan&#x201d; in the native dialect. It enjoys the same climate and growing conditions as Churchill, Manitoba. It is a land of sand hills, cedar swamp, feldspar outcroppings and about half an inch of topsoil.<br>&nbsp;<br>The day he arrived in town, Walt stopped by the office to buy a subscription and we had a chat. I could see what he was doing was very important to him. He wanted more of an audience than just his ducks and chickens. He suggested my readers might be interested in a weekly progress report. I listened to him, without telling him yes or no, because I wanted to think about it. He didn&#x2019;t press me for an answer, which surprised me because you know how city people always want to know everything right now.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then, one day about a week later, I was clearing up at the back after we&#x2019;d closed and I looked up to see Walt pushing an envelope through the mail-slot. The transformation was remarkable. Gone was the three-piece pin-striped suit and in its place was the &#x201c;After Dawn&#x201d; look by Co-op: blue denim bib overalls, a Korean tartan flannelette shirt, brand-new work boots and a green forage hat.<br>&nbsp;<br>I opened the envelope and found a letter that turned out to be the first in a series of missives that now form a kind of farm diary for Walt&#x2019;s first year out on the Seventh Concession.<br><i><br><br>April 21</i><br>Dear Ed,<br>I was delighted to meet you on my first day in Larkspur last week and I enjoyed our chat thoroughly. You may remember my telling you I&#x2019;ve taken over the old Fisher place at R.R. #1, Larkspur, on the Seventh Concession. I&#x2019;ve taken a leave of absence from my firm in Toronto in order to try this experiment in farming, which has long been on my mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>At my age there isn&#x2019;t really much time left for a man to explore some of the things he might have done or been. I&#x2019;ve enjoyed some success in the world of finance, for which I&#x2019;m grateful, but, still, I have a deep and unswerving conviction that a man may pursue his life and satisfy his wants with far less brouhaha than I have experienced so far. Persephone Township is the place to prove it.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Fishers had their auction last Saturday. I watched as the neighbourhood descended on the place and picked it clean. After it was over, and the Fishers had driven off to their new place in town, the auctioneer walked over the property with me. His name is Freddy. He&#x2019;s an interesting chap, friendly and outgoing, and seems to be well-regarded as an auctioneer despite a very noticeable stammer, which brings his sales to a complete halt from time to time. He runs a beef and dairy operation on the farm next door; plants corn, grain, potatoes, turnips; does auction sales, some blacksmithing, small auto repairs and real estate. It&#x2019;s what I believe is called mixed farming. As we walked, Freddy and I talked about the farm and my plans for the summer. Although the sun is warm and some green is starting to show through the dead grass, the ground is still spongy, muddy and wet. We stopped beside an old haywagon parked out behind the barn.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll come in handy,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Freddy pushed his eyebrows up and stared at the sky.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, now, Walt, maybe I should have mentioned this before, b-b-but I lent that wagon to old Fisher last summer. You&#x2019;re welcome to the loan of it, if you like.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>We walked on.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this? A perfectly serviceable old hay-rake. I&#x2019;m glad that wasn&#x2019;t sold at the auction.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, now, there again, Walt, that belongs to The Squire across the road. I asked him to take it away before the auction b-b-but. . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I explained that the first thing I was going to need was some cedar posts for a fence.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;By golly, Walt, old Fisher bought some cedar posts off me last fall and n-n-never picked them up. I guess they belong to you now.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Is there anything else of mine in the neighbourhood?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the next couple of days I lost the hay-wagon and the rake but I had returned to me: fifty cedar posts, a cream separator, a cultivator, a set of harrows, five bags of cement, a load of corn and a horse. The horse is a mare named Dolly or something, but I have named her Feedbin since that is where she can most often be found. She&#x2019;s a spirited creature and seems to have been a racehorse at some time or other, because she can turn only to the left. Consequently, I make a perfect spectacle of myself, riding into Larkspur. Freddy has been no help at all about this.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get used to her,&#x201d; was all he could offer. &#x201c;Besides, you&#x2019;re not going to be using her much!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>That is where he is wrong, for I propose to teach this horse to pull a plough. As I explained to Freddy, when you drive loud machinery, you miss a great deal of what nature has to offer. You can&#x2019;t hear the rich pageantry of life in the hedgerows if you insist on riding around the fields on a noisy tractor. Of course, Freddy couldn&#x2019;t understand this. But he has been extremely helpful none the less. He put out the word and now all the old horse-drawn implements on the Seventh Concession have been pulled out of driving sheds and left in a pile at my gate. With a few small repairs they&#x2019;ll be as good as new.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m not fooling around here. I&#x2019;ve never been more serious in my life. I propose to be as good at this farming game as my neighbours, but, at the same time, I plan to preserve some of the old ways. It won&#x2019;t happen overnight, but eventually, the neighbourhood will come to think of me in much the same light as Montaigne and Thoreau were thought of in their communities&#x2014;gentlemen farmers, rich in barnyard philosophy.<br>&nbsp;<br>I see myself driving into town in the carriage often enough that they&#x2019;ll feel obliged to put up a hitching post in front of the General Store. Won&#x2019;t that be something?<br>&nbsp;<br>Yours sincerely,<br>Walt<br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>May 2</i><br>Dear Ed,<br>I struck the first snag in the livestock department while doing chores this morning. One of my new ducks stood apart from the rest of the flock, rocking uneasily back and forth on his heels, as if someone were trying to push him off balance. When I approached he quacked and fell over, struggled to his feet and went back to wobbling precariously back and forth. All was clearly not well. After chores, I picked him up and started down the lane for the farm across the road. It seemed an excellent opportunity to meet the neighbours for the first time. By giving them an opportunity to show their expertise and offer advice, I hoped to win new friends . . . and cure the duck.<br>&nbsp;<br>As it turned out I met my neighbour in the road, a man known in the community as The Squire. He is an elderly man, round-shouldered and bent over from many years of hard work. He was wearing a shabby pair of patched hound&#x2019;s-tooth trousers, which might have been fashionable for a few weeks in the 1960s, and a long-sleeved shirt with pink flamingos on it. He was busy snatching handfuls of bird&#x2019;s nest out of the mailbox and arguing with a squadron of blackbirds hovering a few feet above his head.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Good morning. I&#x2019;m Walt Wingfield.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He looked up sharply and peered at me as if the morning sun hurt his eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;G&#x2019;day.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>His attention returned to the mailbox. I made another attempt to start conversation.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve taken over the old Fisher place. Lovely morning. Have you lived in the area all your life?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He thought about this for a moment, peered at me again and said, &#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I laughed politely and carried on. &#x201c;I seem to be having a problem with this duck. It doesn&#x2019;t seem to be able to keep its balance. A very bad case of the wobbles, you might say.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>That got his attention. The Squire straightened up and examined the duck more closely.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Wobbles?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve kept ducks before, have you?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I hadn&#x2019;t, but as long as he thought so I wasn&#x2019;t going to persuade him otherwise. &#x201c;So you think it&#x2019;s the wobbles too, do you?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yep. Wobbles.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, now that we know it&#x2019;s the wobbles, what happens next?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;They generally die.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but isn&#x2019;t there something we could do before it dies?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You could hit it over the head and throw it in the ditch. That&#x2019;d save you carryin&#x2019; it back to the barn.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I mean, couldn&#x2019;t we call the vet?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You could do that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter? Is that terribly expensive?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, no. If you got time to carry a duck around I reckon you can afford a vet for him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Squire turned and shuffled his way back up his lane. Our conversation was apparently over.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Appreciate the advice, thanks,&#x201d; I called after him.<br>&nbsp;<br>I picked the duck up and took him back to the house, set him on the verandah and went inside to phone the vet in Larkspur. The vet dismissed our diagnosis about the wobbles and said that it sounded more like coccidiosis. He told me to separate the sick ones from the rest of the flock and then add four milligrams of sulphur dioxisol to a litre of drinking-water. I wrote all this down and then asked him what to do with the sick one. His manner changed abruptly and became quite patronizing.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, is this a small child&#x2019;s pet?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said warmly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to raise ducks for a living.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I see. Well, give it plenty of water, keep it warm and call me tomorrow if there&#x2019;s any change.&#x201d; He rang off before I could question him further.<br>&nbsp;<br>I went back out to the verandah to my patient. He was lying on his side now, describing wide arcs across the cement with his foot. I ran back inside and phoned Freddy. You have to hold the receiver down when you dial Freddy&#x2019;s number because we&#x2019;re on the same party line. The phone rang and rang and finally stopped after the tenth ring. I lifted the receiver and heard Freddy&#x2019;s bright &#x201c;Hyello.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Freddy, do you know anything about ducks?

Well, you run back down there and I&#x2019;ll bet you he&#x2019;s quit that by now. They generally give that up after a bit . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But Freddy.

Even if just for a week or two. But this year, his plans are derailed when he&#39;s offered almost a blank check from a man chasing a rumor. Billionaire Gordon Reese thinks he knows where the bones of the prophet Elisha are--bones that in the Old Testament brought the dead back to life. A born skeptic, Jack doesn&#39;t think much of the assignment but he could use the money, so he takes the first step on a chase for the legendary bones that will take him to the very ends of the earth. But he&#39;s not alone. Joined with a fiery colleague, Esperanza Habilla, they soon discover clues to a shadowy organization whose long-held secrets have been protected . . . at all costs. As their lives are threatened again and again, the real race is to uncover the truth before those chasing them hunt them down.</p><p>The bones of the prophet once raised the dead to life... but they vanished from history in a whisper. Now Jack Hawthorne, part-time skeptic and full-time professor of archaeology, is enlisted to sift them from the sands of time. Bankrolled by a dying man of unlimited means, Hawthorne&#39;s hunt spans the globe and leads him into a deadly conspiracy older than the church itself. And he soon discovers those sworn to keep the secret of the bones will do anything to protect them.Don Hoesel is a Web site designer for a Medicare carrier in Nashville, TN.

Millions of devoted readers and listeners have soared on the glittering wings of Anne&#x2019;s imagination, following book by book the evolution of one of science fiction&#x2019;s most beloved and honored series. Now, for the first time, Anne has invited another writer to join her in the skies of Pern, a writer with an intimate knowledge of Pern and its history: her son, Todd.</p><p></p><p>Young Kindan has no expectations other than joining his father in the mines of Camp Natalon, a coal mining settlement struggling to turn a profit far from the great Holds where the presence of dragons and their riders means safety and civilization. Mining is fraught with danger. Fortunately, the camp has a watch-wher, a creature distantly related to dragons and uniquely suited to specialized work in the dark, cold mineshafts. Kindan&#x2019;s father is the watch-wher&#x2019;s handler, and his son sometimes helps him out. But even that important job promises no opportunity outside the mine.</p><p></p><p>Then disaster strikes. In one terrible instant, Kindan loses his family and the camp loses its watch-wher. Fathers are replaced by sons in the mine&#x2014;except for Kindan, who is taken in by the camp&#x2019;s new Harper. Grieving, Kindan finds a measure of solace in a burgeoning musical talent...and in a new friendship with Nuella, a mysterious girl no one seems to know exists. It is Nuella who assists Kindan when he is selected to hatch and train a new watch-wher, a job that forces him to give up his dream of becoming a Harper; and it is Nuella who helps him give new meaning to his life.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, sparked by the tragedy, long-simmering tensions are dividing the camp. Far below the surface, a group of resentful miners hides a deadly secret. As warring factions threaten to explode, Nuella and Kindan begin to discover unknown talents in the misunderstood watch-wher-talents that could very well save an entire Hold. During their time teaching the watch-wher, the two learn some things themselves: that even a seemingly impossible dream is never completely out of reach...and that light can be found even in the deepest darkness.</p><p></p></p><p>Anne McCaffrey, the Hugo Award-winning author of the bestselling Dragonriders of Pern� novels, is one of science fiction&#x2019;s most popular authors.

A computer engineer, he currently lives in Los Angeles. Having grown up in Ireland with the epic of the Dragonriders of Pern,� he is burst-ing with ideas for new stories of that world, its people, and its dragons.<b>CHAPTER I</b><br><br>In early morning light I see, A distant dragon come to me.<br><br>Kindan was so excited that he practically bounced as he ran up to the heights where Camp Natalon kept its drum, fire beacon, and watch.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re here! They&#x2019;re here!&#x201d; Zenor shouted down at him. Needing no further urging, Kindan put on an extra burst of speed.<br><br>Breathless, he joined his friend on the peak where they kept the watch. Looking down at the valley, he could plainly see the large drays rolling ponderously up toward the main camp. Leading them were the smaller, but bright and cheerfully painted domicile wagons owned by the caravanners.<br><br>From the watch heights, not only could he see all the way across the lake to the bend where the trail turned out of sight, but he could also see the fields on the far side of the lake, which had just been cleared, ready for their first planting of crops. Closer in, he could see where the trail forked, the more heavily traveled way heading up to the depot where the mined and bagged coal was stored, the lighter way leading toward the miners&#x2019; houses on the near side of the lake.<br><br>Most of the houses were in three rows arranged in a U shape around a central square. The open, northern end of the U faced the road. It was there that smaller spice gardens had been planted. And it was in front of those, closer to the main square, that wedding preparations were in progress&#x2014;for Kindan&#x2019;s own sister&#x2019;s wedding.<br><br>None of those houses were &#x201c;proper&#x201d; houses, built to withstand Threadfall. But Threadfall was a long way off&#x2014;another sixteen Turns&#x2014;and the miners were glad to have the temporary comfort of their own housing, convenient to the new mine.<br><br>Midway from the square to the hill was a separate house and a large shed. The house was Kindan&#x2019;s home and the shed housed Dask, the camp&#x2019;s sole remaining watch-wher. Dask was bonded to Kindan&#x2019;s father, Danil.<br><br>Hidden from the watch point by the bend of the hill was a much larger and sturdier dwelling&#x2014;the full stone hold of Natalon, the head Miner in the camp. North of it, separated by a walled-in herb garden, was a smaller but almost as well-built dwelling, the home of the camp&#x2019;s Harper.<br><br>Just beyond the Harper&#x2019;s dwelling&#x2014;the edge of which was visible from the lookout&#x2014;the hillside, a spur from the western mountain, turned abruptly and the plain in front of it rose toward the peak of the mountain, with another spur about two kilometers distant forming a valley. Two hundred meters from the bend and a hundred meters west of the lookout was the entrance to the mine.<br><br>The boys knew the valley like the backs of their hands, even though it was changing daily and Kindan had been there only six months himself. They paid no attention to the view. Today, not even the novelty of the wedding preparations interested them: The two boys had eyes only for the trader caravan winding its way around the lake below them.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Terregar?&#x201d; Zenor asked. &#x201c;Can you see him?&#x201d;<br><br>Kindan squinted and shaded his eyes against the sun with his hand, but mostly for show. The distance was far too great to make out one person in the whole caravan.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he answered irritably. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s down there somewhere.&#x201d;<br><br>Zenor laughed. &#x201c;Well, he&#x2019;d better be, or your Sis will kill him.&#x201d;<br><br>Kindan favored this comment with a glare. &#x201c;Hadn&#x2019;t you better get back on down and tell Natalon?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Zenor replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on watch, not a runner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shards!&#x201d; Kindan groaned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all out of breath, Zenor.&#x201d; He added in a lower tone, &#x201c;And besides, you know how much Natalon wants to hear this news.&#x201d;<br><br>Zenor&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;Oh, yeah, I do! Everyone knows that he was hoping your Sis would stay at the Camp.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Kindan agreed. &#x201c;So just imagine how mad he&#x2019;ll be at hearing about it from me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, come on, Kindan,&#x201d; Zenor replied. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s good news with the bad&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a whole caravan approaching, not just a wedding.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which he has to host,&#x201d; Kindan snapped back. He sighed. &#x201c;Well, if you insist, I&#x2019;ll go back down.&#x201d; He paused dramatically, eyeing his smaller friend. &#x201c;But Sis said that I&#x2019;ve got to wash Dask tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>Zenor&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he considered this. &#x201c;You mean, if I do the running, you&#x2019;ll let me help wash the watch-wher?&#x201d;<br><br>Kindan grinned. &#x201c;Exactly!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You would?&#x201d; Zenor repeated hopefully. &#x201c;Your dad won&#x2019;t mind?&#x201d;<br><br>Kindan shook his head. &#x201c;Not if he doesn&#x2019;t find out, he won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>The added enticement of doing something unsanctioned brought a gleam to Zenor&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;All right, I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, washing a watch-wher&#x2019;s not the same as oiling a dragon,&#x201d; Zenor went on. The thought of Impressing a dragon, of becoming telepathically linked with one of Pern&#x2019;s great fire-breathing defenders, was the secret wish of every child on Pern. But dragons seemed to prefer the children of the Weyr: Only a few riders were chosen from the Holds and Crafts. And no dragon had ever visited Camp Natalon.<br><br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Zenor continued, &#x201c;I saw them.&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone in Camp Natalon knew that Zenor had seen dragons; it was his favorite tale. Kindan suppressed a groan. Instead, he made encouraging noises while hoping that Zenor wouldn&#x2019;t dawdle too much longer or Natalon would be wondering at the speed of his runner&#x2014;and might remember who it was.<br><br>&#x201c;They were so beautiful! A perfect V formation. Way up high. You could see them: bronze, brown, blue, green . . .&#x201d; Zenor&#x2019;s voice faded as he recalled the memory. &#x201c;And they looked so soft&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Soft?&#x201d; Kindan interrupted, his tone full of disbelief. &#x201c;How could they look soft?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, they did! Not like your father&#x2019;s watch-wher.&#x201d;<br><br>Kindan, feeling anger on Dask&#x2019;s behalf, stomped firmly on his emotion, remembering that he still wanted Zenor to run for him.<br><br>&#x201c;Is the caravan getting closer?&#x201d; he asked, hinting broadly.<br><br>Zenor looked, nodded, and sprinted away from the watch point. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t forget, will you?&#x201d; he called back over his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Never!&#x201d; Kindan replied. He was delighted at the thought of help with what he was certain was going to be a particularly thorough bathing of the coal mine&#x2019;s only watch-wher, the night before a major wedding.<br><br> At the bottom of the hillside, after his long, warm scramble down, Zenor paused and looked back up to where Kindan was now standing watch. It was warmer in the valley and the air was thicker, partly from the moisture in the fields, and partly from the smoke already beginning to rise from the Camp&#x2019;s fires. Catching his breath, he turned to search for Miner Natalon. He steered for the largest knot of people he could find, figuring that the Camp&#x2019;s leader would be there. He was right.<br><br>Natalon was a rangy sort of a man who stood taller than the average. Zenor&#x2019;s father, Talmaric, had called Natalon a &#x201c;youngster&#x201d; once, but only in a low voice. After hearing that, Zenor had tried to imagine Natalon as young but couldn&#x2019;t. Even though Talmaric was five Turns older than Natalon, Natalon&#x2019;s twenty-six Turns might have been a full hundred when compared to Zenor&#x2019;s meager ten.<br><br>Zenor considered calling out, but there was still a lot of confusion over the right title for Natalon. He&#x2019;d be &#x201c;Lord Natalon&#x201d; if the Camp proved itself and became a proper Mine but that was still to happen and no one quite knew how to address him now. Zenor opted for worming through the crowd and grabbing at Natalon&#x2019;s sleeve.<br><br>Miner Natalon was not pleased to have someone yank on his sleeve in the middle of an argument. He looked down and saw the sweat-stained face of Talmaric&#x2019;s son but couldn&#x2019;t remember the child&#x2019;s name. It had been so much easier six months earlier, when there&#x2019;d only been himself and a few other miners seeking out a new seam of coal. But finding that seam, and still others after it, had been exactly what Natalon had hoped for&#x2014;to start a Camp and prove it into a Mine.<br><br>Talmaric&#x2019;s son yanked again. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; Natalon said.<br><br>&#x201c;The caravan&#x2019;s approaching, sir,&#x201d; Zenor said, hoping that &#x201c;sir&#x201d; would not affront the Camp&#x2019;s head miner.<br><br>&#x201c;How soon, lad? Don&#x2019;t you know how to make a proper report?&#x201d; a querulous voice barked above Zenor&#x2019;s ears. He turned and saw that the speaker was Tarik, Natalon&#x2019;s uncle. Zenor had had several encounters with Tarik&#x2019;s son, Cristov, and still bore bruises from the last meeting.<br><br>Rumor had it that Tarik was furious that Crom Hold&#x2019;s MasterMiner hadn&#x2019;t put him in charge of seeking out new coal. Another rumor, whispered quietly among only a few of the Camp&#x2019;s boys, was that Tarik was doing everything in his power to prove that Natalon was unsuited to run the Camp and that he, Tarik, should be placed in charge. The last set of bruises Zenor had got from Cristov were the result of an ill-placed comment about Cristov&#x2019;s father.<br><br>&#x201c;How long until they arrive, Zenor?&#x201d; a kinder voice asked. It was Danil, Kindan&#x2019;s father, and the partner of the Camp&#x2019;s only surviving watch-wher.<br><br>&#x201c;I spotted them at the head of the valley,&#x201d; Zenor replied. &#x201c;I imagine it&#x2019;ll be four, maybe six hours until they reach the camp.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;d get here faster if the roadway were properly lined,&#x201d; Tarik growled, casting a reproving glare at Natalon.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Maynards Mermaid (Serendipity)</h2><p>Maynard, a lonesome dragon, learns to look within himself to find a friend.</p><p></p><h2>The Vedas</h2><p>These ancient scriptures of the Hindu teachings are meant to bring into human language the language of the Gods, the Divine powers that have created us.

"'Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, I'm free at last.'" </p><p>What he meant by that reference to King's march on Washington speech, of course, was that, as president, he was freed from accountability to a southern constituency and could be responsive to the needs of all the people. </p><p>"The southerners tell me," he went on, "that they'll buy this bill if I take the public accommodations section out. But I won't do that. The public accommodations part is the heart and the guts of this measure, and I will not remove it." </p><p>I asked him how he came to view public accommodations to be so important and he related a story in response. </p><p>"One day down in Texas many years ago, my maid was going on vacation with her husband. Lady Bird-that's Mrs. Johnson, you know-told the maid to take our dog with her; we had a little beagle. My maid said, 'Mrs. Johnson, please don't make me take that dog with me. My husband and I will be driving across the South and it's going to be tough enough finding places to stay, just being black, without having a dog with us.' </p><p>"Mr. Farmer, that made me cry. Just to think that a wonderful woman like my maid couldn't stay in any hotel she wanted to. It made me mad. I'd lived in Texas all my life and I'd never thought about it before. Right then I swore that if I ever got any power, I would do something about it. Now I have some power and by God I'm going to do something about it." </p><p>I looked at him and said nothing. I found myself thinking of that terrible day less than a month earlier when President Kennedy's brains were blown out in Texas, and of the call I received from Johnson three days later. </p><p>"Mr. Farmer, this is Lyndon Johnson. I first wanted to call and tell you that I remember when you came to my office when I was vice- president. You made a good suggestion to me that helped me a lot. And I asked you to do something for me, and you followed through on that. I just want you to know that I appreciated that a lot." </p><p>"Thank you, Mr. President." </p><p>"Now, we're going to have to pick up this ball and run with it. I'm going to need your help in the months and maybe the years that lie ahead, and I hope I'll get it." </p><p>"If we're going the same way, Mr. President, we can go together." </p><p>"I'm glad to hear you say that. Next time you're in Washington, drop by and see me." </p><p>I knew that Johnson had to win the confidence of black leaders, for the absence of their trust had helped deny him the nomination in 1960. Nevertheless, I was flattered by what came to be known as "the Johnson treatment." Never before had I been called by a president. </p><p>Now, here I was in the Oval Office, still being buttered up by that flattery. The fact that I knew what was happening did not lessen its effectiveness. </p><p>He slapped his knee and drawled, "Well, Jim, I know you're interested in a lot of other things besides this bill. What else can I do to help your cause?" </p><p>I leaned back in the big chair and unbuttoned my collar and loosened tie; I had gained weight and the shirt was not comfortable. </p><p>"Mr. President, there is one thing that keeps me awake nights. We've battered many doors open, and when the civil rights bill is enacted into law, many walls will come tumbling down. Yet, there are millions of Americans of all races who won't be able to walk through those doors or across those fallen walls. The reason? A lack of basic educational skills; the inability to read, write, and compute." </p><p>"I agree a thousand percent," the president said, "but what are we going to do about it? </p><p>"We have in the movement thousands of volunteers with intelligence, dedication, and boundless energies, who don't consider sitting-in, freedom riding, and going to jail to be the most meaningful things in the world any longer. They're standing by now, waiting for direction. Reading specialists can instruct them in teaching adults to read, and we can fan them out through the country. There are over twenty million adults who cannot read up to a fourth-grade level. I believe we can wipe out that functional illiteracy in ten to fifteen years." </p><p>"I think that's a great idea," said Johnson, "and we can make it work."</p></p><h2>Philip-Lorca diCorcia: Hustlers</h2><p>Between 1990 and 1992, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, funded by a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, made multiple trips to Los Angeles to scout locations, invent scenarios and to find male prostitutes that would agree to pose for his camera. The last task proved to be the easiest: diCorcia simply used his fellowship money to pay the men whatever price they charged for their most typical service and ultimately prompted a complaint of misuse of government funds. In 1993, 21 selected images were initially exhibited at The Museum of Modern Art, marking Philip-Lorca diCorcia's first solo exhibition. The show, entitled Strangers was accompanied by a museum catalog. Twenty years later, steidldangin publishes the series in its entirety. <i>Hustlers</i> is an empathetic yet melancholic poem of the Hollywood dream gone wrong, prescribing to the heavily-staged pictorialism and happenstance of street casting for which diCorcia is most widely recognized. Knowing precisely what he wanted from each photograph, and fearful of police involvement, diCorcia would prearrange all settings: this motel room, that vacant lot, in between cars, in a fast-food restaurant--the narrative was always deliberate. From the moment diCorcia approached a potential subject (usually around Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood), to the completion of the shoot, seldom more than one hour had passed. The titles of these encounters amplify the facts--for example: "Ralph Smith, 21 years old, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and $25."</p><p></p><h2>Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution</h2><p>Today the two cultures of "art" and "science" have come to be treated as fundamentally opposed, their aims incompatible. In this remarkable book, Lisa Jardine makes clear that this distinction is both artificial and historically inaccurate.<br><br>The intellectual revolution of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries was the single most formative event in Western history, bringing together the humanities and natural sciences in an unprecedented ferment of conceptual and practical inventiveness. Isaac Newton was as fascinated with the chemical processes involved in the transmutation of metals as he was with the movements of the planets. John Locke was as keen a physician and botanist as he was a philosopher. Christopher Wren pursued anatomical dissections and early blood transfusion with the same vigor as he did architecture.<br><br>These men--among others--opened their minds to the widest possible influences, allowing for huge and brilliant leaps of imagination, for the ingenuity, quick-wittedness, lateral thinking, and inspired guesswork that we now associate with the humanities, not the sciences. But what unified their activities was a genius for technological innovation, for combining the workings of the hand and the brain in one continuous creative process. And it is this that marks the emergence of a distinctive, modern Western Intellectual Tradition.<br><br><b>Ingenious Pursuits</b> focuses on a series of virtuoso advancements--among them the discovery of the circulation of blood, the perfection of the mechanical clock, enhanced astronomical observation, fundamental developments in mathematics, selective animal and plant breeding, and the development of chemical substance analysis--that transformed the thinking of the early modern world and inaugurated forces for change that laid the very foundations for modern thought.<br><br>Revisiting the largely unsung heroes of the Scientific Revolution and their crowded, motley lives, Jardine brilliantly illuminates the practice of science, showing how the discoveries they made grew out of the preoccupations and pressures of an active and engaged everyday life. <b>Ingenious Pursuits</b> is a broad-ranging and highly readable look at the very nature of creativity, at the impact of science on the emerging modern world, and the intellectual revolutions that still shape lives.</p><p>Even Einstein had to eat. We seem to forget that scientists live in the same world as the rest of us, and that their work is informed by everything they encounter day to day. Lisa Jardine explores this interconnectedness in the context of the late 17th-century scientific revolution in <i>Ingenious Pursuits</i>, a well-planned journey back in time that delivers precious insight into the lives of those who laid the groundwork for cloning, nuclear weapons, and Internet commerce. Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Gian Domenico Cassini are just a few of the multitalented explorers that Jardine profiles through diaries, letters, and scientific records. Taking the time to fully flesh out the lives of these adventurous spirits, she shows the reader that science began as a natural curiosity about the material world, inspired by diverse interests: art, religion, medicine, engineering, and more.<p> Political meddling in science is nothing new; even 300 years ago rulers competed for knowledge and the status that came from scientific achievement. Jardine expands on this premise to see the colonial expansion of the time as a driving force behind research, responsible for the contemporary explosions in cartography, botany, and optics. While <i>Ingenious Pursuits</i> stays for the most part in the 17th century, it does remind us of our own interwoven scientific and social threads, and that perhaps the next revolutionary breakthrough will come about as much because of telemarketers as National Science Foundation grants. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Lisa Jardine is author of the highly acclaimed <b>Worldly Goods: A New History of the Renaissance</b>.

Although the author acknowledges that partisan animosities played an important role in the disintegration of peaceful discourse into violence, she argues that conventional political conflicts were intensified by other concerns. <br>Through an analysis of the evolution of violence in Antioquia, which at the time was the wealthiest and most economically diverse region of Colombia, Rold�n demonstrates how tensions between regional politicians and the weak central state, diverse forms of social prejudice, and processes of economic development combined to make violence a preferred mode of political action. Privatization of state violence into paramilitary units and the emergence of armed resistance movements exacted a horrible cost on Colombian civic life, and these processes continue to plague the country.<br>Roldan&#x2019;s reading of the historical events suggests that Antioquia&#x2019;s experience of <i>la Violencia</i> was the culmination of a brand of internal colonialism in which regional identity formation based on assumptions of cultural superiority was used to justify violence against racial or ethnic "others" and as a pretext to seize land and natural resources. <i>Blood and Fire </i>demonstrates that, far from being a peculiarity of the Colombians, <i>la Violencia </i>was a logical product of capitalist development and state formation in the modern world.<br>This is the first study to analyze intersections of ethnicity, geography, and class to explore the genesis of Colombian violence, and it has implications for the study of repression in many other nations.</p><p>"Mary Rold�n's enduring commitment to the history of Colombia, and to the principles of thoroughness, fairness, and accuracy, combine to make this a truly exceptional book. Colombia is perhaps the least-known or understood country in Latin America, and yet the United States' involvement with it only continues to grow. By following the day-to-day evolution of partisan conflict in the region of Antioquia during the dreadful period of carnage remembered simply as la Violencia, Rold�n makes possible a crucial understanding of the current violence in that beautiful and baffling Andean country."&#x2014;Alma Guillermoprieto, author of Looking for History: Dispatches from Latin America <p>"This marvelous book makes important contributions in multiple ways. Beyond her nuanced analysis of the la Violencia and of sociopolitical values and ethnic/racial attitudes in Antioquia, Roldan illuminates important features of the political system. Her work, already influential among scholars working on twentieth-century Colombia, fortunately will now be available to a wider audience."&#x2014;Frank Safford, author of Colombia: Fragmented Land, Divided Society</p>&#34;This marvelous book makes important contributions in multiple ways.

Even incest is now discussed freely in the popular media, but the suicide of a loved one is still an act most people are unable to talk about--or even admit to their closest family and friends. This is just one of the many painful and paralyzing truths author Carla Fine discovered when her husband, a successful young physician, took his own life in December 1989. And being unable to speak openly and honestly about the cause of her pain made it all the more difficult for her to survive.<br><br>With <i>No Time to Say Goodbye</i>, she brings suicide survival from the darkness into the light, speaking frankly and with compassion about the overwhelming feelings of confusion, guilt, shame, anger and loneliness that are shared by all survivors. Drawing on her own experience and on conversations with many other survivors--as well as on the knowledge of counselors and mental health professionals--Carla Fine offers a strong helping hand and invaluable guidance to the thousands of husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, friends and lovers who are left behind each year, struggling to make sense of an act that seems to them senseless, and to pick up the pieces of their own shattered lives. And, perhaps most important, she allows them to see that they are not alone in their feelings of grief and despair.<br><br>Her resource section, listing organizations and survivor groups throughout the United States and Canada, as well as her bibliography of further reading, will, in themselves, provide invaluable information and support.</p><p>"<i>No Time to Say Goodbye</i> has put into words my experiences of a decade. The knowledge to be gained by reading this book is impossible to estimate, and I recommend it to all who have experienced a loss to suicide, regardless of how long ago. I also recommend it to my colleagues who will or have lost a client to suicide, and finally, to all people in our country so they may no longer be confused about the impact of suicide. Carla Fine safely and gently takes the reader on a journey that until now has been indescribable."<br>--Frank Campbell, President, American Association of Suicidology<p>"Suicide survivors will hear in Carla Fine's extraordinary book what we all too rarely hear--the honest and deeply human voices of others who have endure the bafflement and desolation of a loved one's suicide. We learn here that the dark legacy of suicide can be borne with dignity, forgiveness and hope."<br>--Larry Lockridge, Ph.D., author of <i>Shade of the Raintree: The Life and Death of Ross Lockridge, Jr. author of</i> Raintree County.<br></p>"I wish had the comfort and wisdom of this book. It might have eased the pain of over thirty years," --Gerry Spence, auhtor of <b>The Making of a Country Lawyer</b> and <b>How to Argue and Win Every Time</b><br><br>"Full of stories.

He was briefly a Professor of Horticulture at Harvard University&#39;s Bussey Institution (his successor at Harvard was Charles Sprague Sargent, creator and head of the Arnold Arboretum for more than 50 years) and the President of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. In the 1850s, he purchased land bordering Jamaica Pond for his summer home. Today, the Francis Parkman Memorial sits near the former site of the house, while Francis Parkman Drive runs through the former location of his rose garden.</p><h2>The Prince</h2><p><p>In mid-1920s Iran in a crumbling house in a provincial town, the last survivor of a deposed dynasty is slowly dying from tuberculosis. The old prince's domain has been reduced to his domestic household, where the former glories of his ancestors haunt him. Drifting in and out of reality, the prince relives episodes of his forbearers&#x2019; exulted and often brutal past; a macabre time of public despotism when men were put to death by being sheathed in plaster, and when a child might be beheaded as punishment for poor schoolwork. Long-dead relatives threaten menacingly from photographs the old prince surrounds himself with, damaged images fleetingly brought to life by a fractured hallucinatory mind, only to fade away as another vestige from the past rattles in its picture frame. As hazy memories bleed into one another, it soon becomes clear that the most torturous for the dying man is that of his wife Fakronessa, who used to taunt him with the energy and violence of his grandfather and great-grandfather, forcing him then to avenge himself by sleeping with their servant Fakhri, and subsequently driving his wife to an early grave.</p></p><p><b>Hushang Golshiri</b> (1937-2000) was born in Isfahan, Iran. He worked as a teacher, published a collection of short stories and edited a literary journal. In 1978 he travelled to the USA, but returned the following year to become a leading writer and critic of post-revolution Iran.

His interest, unique at the time, was twofold: to assess the art as creative work, and to use it as a way of studying mental illness. Prinzhorn&#39;s Collection attracted the attention of many artists, including Paul Klee and Oskar Schlemmer, but by the 1930s, when the Nazis declared such work &#34;degenerate,&#34; the Collection fell into disrepair. Only in recent decades has it been properly restored and made available for a wider public. This catalog accompanied the first exhibition in Britain to foreground the Prinzhorn Collection as a whole.

Questions about the role and responsibility of architects in disaster recovery have been circulating since the Indian Ocean tsunami killed more than 200,000 people in 2004. In the last decade, 200 million people have been affected by natural disasters and hazards. Ninety-eight percent of these victims are in the developing world, where billions of dollars in aid are absorbed annually by climatic and geologic crises. Those in the developed world are not immune, as extreme temperatures, intense heat waves, increased flooding and droughts expose vast numbers of people to the experience of the eco-refugee. <i>Beyond Shelter</i> is a call to action. It features 20 generously illustrated reports from the field, written by the founders of some of the world's most provocative architecture and engineering firms and studios (Arup, Estudio Teddy Cruz, Urban Think Tank); accomplished nonprofits and research centers (Architectes de l'Urgence, Article 25 Development and Disaster Relief, the Institute for Sustainable Solutions at Portland State University, Development Workshop France); and leaders of such prominent organizations as the Red Cross, UN-Habitat and the World Wildlife Fund. All of these people are on the frontlines of disaster prevention and recovery, in rural and urban areas alike. <i>Beyond Shelter</i> presents projects in such diverse locales as Manila, New Orleans, Gujarat, S�o Paulo, rural Vietnam, Kashmir, the Gola Forest in Sierra Leone, Greensburg, Kansas and the village of Soba, outside Khartoum. Together they illustrate the reality that evolving risk requires new ways of thinking, and that architects have a leading role to play.</p><p></p><h2>Taste of Home&#39;s 2001 Quick Cooking Annual Recipes</h2><p>New inside and out ,Unread...

The journey begins in Maria's house and then moves outward to the street, town, country, continent, hemisphere, planet, solar system, galaxy, and, finally, the universe. With each new widening perspective, children can explore the vastness of the world around them as they discover their own special place in space.</p><p>Margery Cuyler's accessible text and Yu Cha Pak's richly detailed illustrations offer an intriguing introduction to geography and astronomy for the youngest armchair traveler.</p></p><p><p>Margery Cuyler is the author of many books for children, including <i>The Little Dump Truck, That's Good!

Ms. Pak is the illustrator of <i>Benito's Dream Bottle</i>, by Naomi Shihab Nye. She lives in Houston, Texas.</p>Pak (Benito's Dream Bottle) endows Cuyler's (The Biggest, Best Snowman) brief text with stellar dimensions in this heartfelt picture book. As the narrative begins, "My name is Maria Mendoza," the artist cleverly interprets the words as the beginning of a letter Maria composes at a desk to an unseen recipient. Over the course of the next 13 gorgeously rendered full-bleed spreads, young Maria describes her family ("I live with my father, my mother, my baby brother Tony..."), her street address, town, county, state, etc., finally concluding with "in the universe and beyond." Like a photographer, Pak shifts the perspective: as Maria mentions her family, the illustration reveals an intimate kitchen scene in which her father prepares vegetables and her mother reads a book to the baby (Maria is just visible through an open door); similar details of the girl's town and state unfold in succeeding spreads (bluebonnets, an armadillo, oil rigs and more dot a drawing of Texas). While Maria's address ends in the vastness of space, the book itself does not. Instead, Pak brings readers full circle to a closing view of Maria at her window, gazing out at a world that seems both expansive and enveloping. "From here to there," the text quietly affirms, "my name is Maria Mendoza." The artist's warmly rendered domestic scenes bring to mind contemporary Latin American art. As the geographic scale of the artwork widens, the compositions become simpler and bolder, culminating with a stunning panorama of space. This enlightening journey is both a meditation on humanity's small place in the universe and a celebration of each person's immutable individuality.

So began the stormy marriage between Lord and Lady Grange, a marriage which was to end with Lady Grange&#39;s death on the Isle of Skye after 13 years in exile. The daughter of a convicted murderer, Lady Grange&#39;s behaviour, such as her fondness for drink, was so outrageous that her sudden disappearance from public life was not considered surprising. But few knew the true story of her disappearance. This book reveals, for the first time, how the unfortunate lady was violently kidnapped and transported to the remote islands off the west coast of Scotland, spending seven years on the island of St. Kilda&#39;s. Condemned to a very different lifestyle than she had enjoyed in Edinburgh, and baffled by the strange tongue of the Gaelic West, she still obstinately survived, finally dying in Skye in 1745.</p><p>MARGARET MACAULAY was born in Campbeltown, Argyll, in 1934 and educated at Campbeltown Grammar School.

Leithart argues that the coming of the New Creation in Jesus Christ has profound and revolutionary implications for social order, implications symbolized and effected in the ritual of baptism. In Christ and Christian baptism, the ancient distinctions between priest and non-priest, between patrician and plebian, are dissolved, giving rise to a new humanity in which there is no Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female. Yet, beginning in the medieval period, the church has blunted the revolutionary force of baptism, and reintroduced antique distinctions whose destruction was announced by the gospel. Leithart calls the church to renew her commitment to the gospel that offers &#34;priesthood to the plebs&#34;</p><p>Peter Leithart is an ordained minister of the Pacific Northwest Presbytery, Presbyterian Church in America, and senior fellow of theology and literature at New St. Andrews College, Moscow, Idaho.</p><h2>Le Corbusier</h2><p>A huge influence on big Hamptons builder Charles Gwathmey, not to mention on many others, was Swiss genius Charles douard Jeanneret-Gris, better known as Le Corbusier (1887-1965).

As well as the predictable roll call of saints and martyrs, the Society can also lay claim to the thirty-five craters on the moon named for Jesuit scientists. Jesuits have been despised and idolized on a scale unknown to members of any other religious order; they have died the most horrible deaths and done the most outlandish deeds.<br><br>Whether loved or loathed, the Jesuits&#x2019; dramatic and wide-ranging impact could never be ignored. By the mid-eighteenth century, they had established more than 650 educational institutions. They were also strongly committed to foreign missions, and like the secular explorers and settlers of the Age of Discovery, they traveled to the Far East, India, and the Americas to stake a claim. They were especially successful in Latin America, where they managed to put numerous villages entirely under Jesuit rule.<br><br>The Jesuits&#x2019; successes both in Europe and abroad, coupled with rumors of scandal and corruption within the order, soon drew criticism from within the Church and without. Writers such as Pascal and Voltaire wrote polemics against them, and the absolute monarchs of Catholic Europe sought to destroy them. Their power was seen as so threatening that hostility escalated into serious political feuds, and at various times they were either banned or harshly suppressed throughout Europe.<br><br><i>God&#x2019;s Soldiers</i> is a fascinating chronicle of this celebrated, mysterious, and often despised religious order.

The feeble, neglected defenses of the city were breached with embarrassing ease, and the soldiers, undisciplined, unpaid, grumbling about months of pestilence and hunger, embarked upon a spree of looting, vandalism, and fleshy excess. Very quickly, reliable, sober reports of workshop smashing, iconoclasm, and theft merged with the more gruesome stories of torture, dismemberment, and serial rape. Across Europe, for generations to come, tales would be told of entire hospitals and orphanages being emptied, their helpless inmates drowned in the blood-gorged waters of the Tiber.<br><br>Charles, Habsburg ruler of Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands, was quick to deny all responsibility for his renegade forces. The Italian Wars, the dynastic struggles inaugurated by a French king's crossing of the Alps in 1494, had once more flaunted their uncanny talent for blighting southern Europe.<br><br>The sack of Rome sent monks and artists scurrying, and it convulsed the Western imagination. Not until the grotesque Parisian carnage of the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, four decades later--when hundreds of French Protestants lost their lives--would Europe be quite so scandalized, quite so shaken. The events of May 1527 were really about dynastic politics and disgruntled, leaderless troops. Religious animosity played its part--shrines were desecrated, cardinals were threatened, and one especially zealous participant brandished a golden rope with which he intended to hang the pope--but Spanish Catholics had contributed to the mayhem just as eagerly as German Lutherans.<br><br>What truly mattered, though, was the symbolism. Rome, the place that stood for papal plenitude, for Italian Renaissance grandeur, for the Roman Catholic Church, had, as one onlooker put it, become a cadaver of a city. The Venetian ambassador suggested that not even hell itself could offer so miserable a vista. In 1527, a decade on from the first stirrings of reformation, there was still much hope that schism might be averted and schismatics reconciled. But the sight of a ruined, ransacked Rome, of a pope hidden away in the Castel Sant'Angelo, was an eloquent reminder of how much had changed since Martin Luther's Wittenberg revolution, since the iconoclasm of Ulrich Zwingli's Zurich, since the withering assault on Catholic dogmas, rituals, and certainties had begun. Anarchic weeks that can best be blamed on the quarrels of supremely Catholic kings had managed to sum up Christendom's newly found frailty.<br><br>And at this bleakest of moments, Ignatius Loyola, the Jesuits' future founder and first superior general, was about to arrive in Salamanca, as part of his search for a belated education. Within a few decades his place in the Catholic pantheon would be secure, and at his death a viceroy of Sicily could confidently announce that "after so many battles and victories he has taken up his rightful place in heaven alongside Dominic and Francis."5 In the mission fields of seventeenth-century Canada, pregnant women, having struggled in labor for twenty-four hours, would have Ignatian relics applied to their stomachs and babies would apparently rush into the world; a man with a burning fever would be urged to invoke Loyola's name, and in an instant he would be rendered as "cool as a fish."6<br><br>But in the summer of 1527, the heirs of St. Dominic had not been so sure of Loyola's credentials. Rather, they had invited him to a meal at their San Esteban convent, questioned him about his suspect brand of spirituality, and consigned him to twenty-two days in prison. Throughout its history, the Society of Jesus would enjoy similar encounters with the machinery of Catholic orthodoxy, whether the Inquisition or the papal Index. It was the kind of setback to which Loyola, incarcerated for six weeks at Alcal? a year earlier, was growing accustomed.<br><br>For the man who would soon be likened to David--providentially sent to combat Luther's Goliath, to help the Catholic world recover from indignities such as the sack of Rome--these were inauspicious beginnings: an early sign that there was to be nothing easy or inevitable about the Jesuits' contribution to the defense and renovation of the Roman Catholic Church.<br>Loyola<br>When Loyola died, at Rome, in 1556, his autopsy revealed a body wasted by disease. Renaldo Colombo, holder of the chair of anatomy at Padua University, reported, "I extracted almost innumerable gallstones of various colours that I found in the kidney, the lungs, the liver and the portal vein."7 There was a distinct lack of Xavierian incorruptibility. For years, Loyola had been a part-time patient, often made worse by inept medical advice: one doctor even prescribed that he be shut indoors during the summer months and be given nothing to drink but strong wine--hardly the most suitable regimen for a man prone to stomachaches and systemically weakened by extreme austerities and mortifications earlier in life.8 But at least Loyola had suffered one worthwhile injury, back in May 1521, when it was definitively proven that a cannonball shot to the legs could do much for a person's hopes of sainthood.<br><br>The facts of Loyola's early life are not easy to excavate. Any account inevitably relies on his so-called autobiography, dictated late in life to his close friend Lu's Gonzalves da Camara, a work that was always destined, first and foremost, to be an inspirational exercise in rousing admiration among future members of the Society of Jesus.9 But basic facts there are. Born in 1491 at the castle of Loyola in northern Spain, close to Azpeitia in the province of Guipuezcoa, Inigo Lopez de Loyola was destined for a typical courtier's life, entering the service of Juan Velazquez de Cuellar at Arevalo at the age of thirteen and, by his own admission, quickly developing a taste for brawling and for unseemly encounters with women.<br><br>In 1517, military duty under Antonio Manrique de Lara, viceroy of Navarre, beckoned, and it was four years later, when Loyola was facing French troops at the battle for Pamplona, that the fabled cannonballs entered the historical record. His right leg was shattered and his left badly injured. While recuperating back at home, it seems that Loyola was deprived of his favorite chivalric literature and had to make do with reading Ludolph of Saxony's <i>Life of Christ</i> and the saint-filled <i>Golden Legend</i> of Jacopo de Voragine. And that, so we are told, is when the extraordinary transformation began. Loyola apparently discerned something enviable in the heroic lives of the saints, a sort of spiritual chivalry, and he determined to emulate it. Or as a caustic account from Enlightenment France would have it, the "Spanish gentlemen . . . having had his brain heated by romances of chivalry and afterwards by books of devotion, took it into his head to be the Don Quixote of the Virgin."10<br><br>Loyola's account of the next few years is replete with epochal, stirring moments. A night spent before the Black Madonna at the Benedictine monastery in Montserrat prompted Loyola to exchange his robe and sword for a pilgrim's staff and the rough cloak and sandals of a beggar. A spell at Manresa saw him begging, praying, fasting, and flagellating, allowing his hair and fingernails to grow to uncommon length, being treated to visions, and working on his <i>Spiritual Exercises</i>. The <i>Exercises</i>, on which Loyola continued to work over the coming decades, would emerge as the lodestone of a distinctive Ignatian spirituality--arguably one of the most impressive, enduring Jesuit contributions to the Roman Catholic tradition. Over the next five centuries, Loyola's spiritual vision--optimistic, rooted in notions of magnanimity and fraternity--would lead Catholics through prayer and meditation, allowing them to examine their consciences, convincing them that their God was in all things and that it was entirely possible for them to discern the specific will of their Creator in their individual lives.<br><br>By 1523 Loyola was visiting the holy sites of Jerusalem, but when it became clear that the city was far too dangerous for an extended stay, he opted to return to Europe in pursuit of a university education. After two years at Barcelona, taking Latin classes with children, Loyola moved on to the lecture halls of Alcal? in 1526 and Salamanca in 1527, the university towns where his preaching and theologizing (reminiscent to some minds of the outlawed <i>alumbrado</i> movement) first attracted unwelcome attention.11 Released by the Dominicans of Salamanca without prejudice (although they urged him to remain silent on certain theological issues), Loyola rode a donkey to Barcelona and decided to cross over into France. Friends warned him that given the political climate, he risked a hostil...</p><h2>The BFG Movie Tie-In</h2><p><b>The tie-in edition to the major motion picture adaptation from Steven Spielberg and Dreamworks Studios!&nbsp;</b><br><br>The BFG is no ordinary bone-crunching giant.

After all, he eats only disgusting snozzcumbers, and while the other Gs are snacking on little boys and girls, he's blowing happy dreams in through their windows. What kind of way is that for a G to behave?<p> The BFG is one of Dahl's most lovable character creations. Whether galloping off with Sophie nestled into the soft skin of his ear to capture dreams as though they were exotic butterflies; speaking his delightful, jumbled, squib-fangled patois; or whizzpopping for the Queen, he leaves an indelible impression of bigheartedness. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p>Roald Dahl was a spy, ace fighter-pilot, chocolate historian and medical inventor.

The authors argue that it is only by having a sense of common ground, between mind in science and mind in experience that our understanding of cognition can be more complete. To create this common ground they develop a dialogue between cognitive science and Buddhist meditative psychology and situate this dialogue in relation to other traditions, such as phenomenology and psychoanalysis. The dialogue proceeds in five parts. The first introduces the two partners and explains how the dialogue will develop. The second presents the computational model of mind that gave rise to cognitive science in its classical form. The authors show how this model implies that the self is fundamentally fragmented and introduce the complementary Buddhist concept of a nonunified, decentralized self. The third shows how cognitive science and Buddhist psychology provide the resources for understanding how the phenomena usually attributed to a self could arise without an actual self. The fourth presents the authors&#39; own view of cognition as embodied action and discusses the relevance of this view for cognitive science and evolutionary theory. The fifth considers the philosophical and experiential implications of the view that cognition has no foundation or ground beyond its history of embodiment and explores these implications in relation to contemporary Western critiques of objectivism and the nonfoundationalist tradition of Buddhist philosophy.</p><p>Francisco J. Varela (1946&#x2013;2001) was Director of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique, Professor of Cognitive Science and Epistemology, CREA, at the Ecole Polytechnique, Paris, and Cofounder of the Mind and Life Institute.<p>One of the main difficulties of the science of the mind is to explain how consciousness is possible without there being a transcendental Self that is the receptacle for all experience or a transcendental 'I' that accompanies all experience. <i>The Embodied Mind</i> blends insights from cognitive neuroscience and the Buddhist theory of mind to show how consciousness is possible without any self at all! The book is tremendously helpful in sparing us the illusion that there is a 'mind's 'I'.'</p> (Owen Flanagan, Class of 1919 Professor, Wellesley College)<br><br><p>Our concern is to open a space of possibilities in which the circulation between cognitive science and human experience can be fully appreciated and to foster the transformative possibilities of human experience in a scientific culture.</p> (<b>the authors</b>)<br><br><p> <i>The Embodied Mind </i> is a thoroughly original integration of cognitive science, continental philosophy, and Buddhist thought, and in its transpersonal dimension, rather beautiful. </p> (<b>Gordon G.

This enthralling memoir follows her through triumph and tragedy in about equal measure, from the disastrous marriage of her parents and the often difficult wartime childhood that followed, to her own marriage to the brilliant young journalist Nicholas Tomalin. When he was killed on assignment as a war correspondent she was left to bring up their four children - and at the same time make her own career. She writes of the intense joys of a fascinating progression as she became one of the most successful literary editors in London before discovering her true vocation as a biographer, alongside overwhelming grief at the loss of a child. Writing with the �lan and insight which characterize her biographies, Claire Tomalin sets her own life in a wider cultural and political context, vividly and frankly portraying the social pressures on a woman in the Fifties and Sixties, and showing &#39;how it was for a European girl growing up in mid-twentieth-century England ... carried along by conflicting desires to have children and a worthwhile working life.&#39;</p><p>Claire Tomalin was literary editor of the New Statesman then the Sunday Times before leaving to become a full-time writer.

In this. newest installment in the social studies-themed Ms. Frizzle's Adventures, the creators of the Magic School Bus books send Frizzle and friends to eleventh-century China. The point of departure is Chinatown, and the magical conveyance is not a bus but a giant, "cavorting paper dragon," whose dancers convey Frizzle, Wanda, Wanda's older'brother, and Arnie (whom they intercept en route to ung fu class) across time and space to "the land of [Wanda's] ancestors." The plot, which involves a quest to relieve peasants of their tax burden, is less noteworthy than the sheer density of material in the graphic-novel-inspired spreads. Readers will savor sidebars touting Chinese contributions to society, pore over Degen's delightfully cluttered compositions and lovely chinoiserie embellishments, and smile at the endnote, styled as uptight caveats ("time travel is impossible") from a panel of "Very Smart" critics. A celebration of culture as bountiful as the feast that Frizzle and Arnie share with Wanda's large Chinese American family at book's end. -Jennifer Mattson<br>Kirkus (Kirkus Reviews, June 15, 2005 (Vol. 73, No. 12))<br>Ducking beneath a parade dragon in Chinatown, Ms. Frizzle and three youngsters emerge a thousand years ago and halfway around the world. For her third excursion into the past, she takes advantage of this tailor-made teachable moment to squire her charges from rice fields to the Imperial Palace in Beijing. They hardly pause along the way for looks at silk- and tea-making, Chinese poetry and writing, inventions, the Great Wall (errantly declared to be 30,000 miles long-off by a factor of about 10, depending on what's measured) and even how to hold chopsticks. Impoverished rice farmers are clean and smiling in Degen's brightly colored, crisply drawn illustrations, but there are at least hints that not everyone's a happy camper, and the pictures do add further cultural and historical detail with running panels along the bottom of each spread.

During a Chinese New Year's celebration, the teacher; a Chinese-American student, Wanda; Wanda's older brother Henry; and the ever-reluctant Arnold travel back in time 1000 years and arrive in a farmers' village. While there, they learn to grow rice, eat with chopsticks, and make silk. Ms. Frizzle is as curious and irrepressible as ever as she and her students travel north by barge, cart, and foot to the Great Wall and finally to the capital city. The endnotes explain which aspects of the story are historically accurate and where the author and illustrator have taken small liberties. The cartoon illustrations, done in a mix of pen and ink, watercolor, and colored pencil and gouache, continue the frenetic, zany humor of the Magic School Bus&#x201d; series. Small panels on each page highlight facts about Imperial China, such as items first invented in China, how to bow, and the basics of writing.

After educational excursions to ancient Egypt (Ms. Frizzle's Adventures: Ancient Egypt, rev. 11/01) and a medieval castle, she now leads three youngsters back a thousand years into China's past. Ms. Frizzle recounts her adventures in the first person, while dialogue bubbles, labels, and sly visual jokes extend the narrative. A band of detailed drawings runs across the lower third of most pages, conveying relevant facts about Chinese customs, scientific discoveries, and inventions. Launching her journey from Chinatown, Ms. Frizzle and her fellow time travelers land in a farming village, where they learn that a poor rice harvest has left the farmers unable to pay their taxes. Ms. Frizzle decides to lead her companions north to plead their case before the emperor himself. This journey, by barge and on foot, provides a lively introduction to China's geography, principal products, and famous sit es. Degen opens himself to the influence of Chinese art, portraying ancient China with lighthearted but generally accurate illustrations. This is not intended to be a coherent, organized introduction to ancient China; instead, like the luscious banquet in the final spread, Cole and Degan's book offers a spicy, intriguing taste that may tempt readers to ask for more.

He lives in upstate New York. Gayle Ross, published author, storyteller and lecturer, is a descendant of John Ross, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation during the &#34;Trail of Tears.&#34; Her books, How Rabbit Tricked Otter and The Girl Who Married the Moon have received glowing reviews.Bruchac and Ross (How Rabbit Tricked Otter) team up for a companion volume to Bruchac's Flying with Eagle, Racing with Great Bear, a collection of Native American tales that focused on boys' rites of passage. Here, girls or young women are the protagonists of 16 stories intended "to reach the daughters and granddaughters who will come after." Becoming a woman and marrying correctly are common themes: brave and resourceful heroines escape monsters and kidnappers, comically avoid marriage to trickster Owl or tragically die with their husbands. Unusual selections include "The Beauty Way," a recounting of an Apache rite of passage; "Stonecoat," the defeat of an evil and powerful medicine man by women who use the power of their "moontime"; and the title story, in which a girl not only marries the moon but shares his job with him. Comments on the stories open the four sections of the book (Northeast, Northwest, Southeast and Southwest), each of which contains tales from four different nations (e.g., Penobscot, Seneca, Passamaquoddy and Mohegan for the Northeast). An afterword and source notes close this useful resource for storytelling and multicultural learning.

Solomon starts by uncovering certain pervasive narcissistic myths and exploring what it means to be intimate in a culture that values autonomy and self-fulfillment above all. She shows that experiences in early childhood can lead to narcissistic vulnerability in later relationships. Case examples from her practice clarify how two individuals' feeling states and defenses mesh in the marital system and how the attempt to defend against emotional injury creates barriers to intimacy. The second part of the book focuses on treatment and on ways to change.</p><p>In our culture we demand a great deal from our intimate relationships--and we are often disappointed.

Dunn</b>, Durham University<br><br>"Peter Oakes has delivered the goods in his much-anticipated Galatians commentary. Despite the many difficult passages in Galatians, Oakes provides a judicious and magisterial treatment of the text. His study of Galatians is informed by archaeological, sociological, and historical data usually ignored by most scholars. He also does not shy away from mapping the theological implications of the text. Oakes's commentary is a great reminder that the Brits still do some of the best work in biblical exegesis."<br>--<b>Michael F. Bird</b>, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia<br><br>"Drawing on his extensive knowledge of Paul's social world, Peter Oakes here offers a fresh reading of Galatians that is historically secure, exegetically precise, and theologically relevant.

Students and scholars alike will relish this engaging exposition of Paul's most radical letter."<br>--<b>John M.&nbsp;G. Barclay</b>, Durham University<br><br>"In <i>Galatians</i> Peter Oakes combines a deep grasp of the ancient social context, a close familiarity with the exegetical issues, and an insightful identification of contemporary theological questions that are impacted and provoked by this potent Pauline letter. He couples this with a succinct style and an elegant delivery to produce an ideal <i>vade</i> <i>mecum</i> on this text."<br>--<b>Philip Esler</b>, University of Gloucestershire<br><br>"In this eminently readable and erudite commentary, Peter Oakes guides the reader through the text and argument of Paul's Letter to the Galatians with careful exegesis and theological sensitivity.

Goshawk Squadron was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1971.In 1916 Oliver Paxton, very young and only recently awarded his wings, ferries a plane to France and hopes for glory in the Great War. Assigned to the Hornet Squadron, his attitudes make him something of an outcast; and the varied views of war and duty lead to his being grounded for a time. Breakdowns, deaths, and pressure at first cannot dim Paxton's determination to do or die for England. When a comrade dies Paxton finally comes to accept the futility and insanity of war.

It is made up of both the long-term chronically poor and new working poor&#x2014;the tens of millions of victims of a broken economy and an ever more dysfunctional political system. In many ways, for the majority of Americans, financial insecurity has become the new norm.<br><br><i>The American Way of Poverty</i> shines a light on this travesty. Sasha Abramsky brings the effects of economic inequality out of the shadows and, ultimately, suggests ways for moving toward a fairer and more equitable social contract. Exploring everything from housing policy to wage protections and affordable higher education, Abramsky lays out a panoramic blueprint for a reinvigorated political process that, in turn, will pave the way for a renewed War on Poverty.<br><br>It is, Harrington believed, a moral outrage that in a country as wealthy as America, so many people could be so poor. Written in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse, in an era of grotesque economic extremes, <i>The American Way of Poverty</i> brings that same powerful indignation to the topic.<br></p><p>Sasha Abramsky is a freelance journalist and a part-time lecturer in the University Writing Program, at the University of California, Davis. His work has appeared in the <i>Nation</i>, the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>New York</i> magazine, the <i>Village Voice</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and many other publications. In 2000 he was awarded an Open Society, Crime, and Communities Media Fellowship, and he is currently a Senior Fellow at Demos, the New York City-based think tank. His work on poverty was funded by a grant from the Open Society Foundations' Special Fund for Poverty Alleviation. He lives in Sacramento, California.<br>[This] portrait of poverty is one of great complexity and diversity, existential loneliness and desperation but also amazing resilience Abramsky's well-researched, deeply felt depiction of poverty is eye-opening, and his outrage is palpable. He aims to stimulate discussion, but whether his message provokes action remains to be seen.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>"Abramsky's portraits of the poor illustrate three striking points: the isolation, diversity-people with no jobs and people with multiple jobs-and resilience of the poor. Drawing on ideas from a broad array of equality advocates, Abramsky offers detailed policies to address poverty, including reform in education, immigration, energy, taxation, criminal justice, housing, Social Security, and Medicaid, as well as analysis of tax and spending policies that could reduce inequities."<br> <b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>"Sasha Abramsky takes us deep into the long dark night of poverty in America, and it's a harrowing trip. His research and remarkable insights have resulted in a book that is stunning in its intensity."<br> <b>Bob Herbert, Distinguished Senior Fellow at Demos and former Op-Ed columnist for the <i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>"Incisive and necessary, The American Way of Poverty is a call to action."<br> <b>Lynn Nottage, Pulitzer-prize-winning playwright</b><br><br>"Abramsky has written an ambitious book that both describes and prescribes. He reaches across a wised range of issues-including education, housing and criminal justice- in a sweeping panorama of poverty's elements. Assembling them in one volume forces him to be superficial on occasion, but that price is worth paying to get the broad scope... Abramsky has invited serious rethinking and issued a significant call to action."<br> <b>David Shipler, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>"[An] extraordinary book... extremely well researched and thorough..."<br> <b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>"Abramsky's approach is both heartbreaking in its look at the humans who are affected and inspiring in his explanations of how poverty can be addressed and improved... <i>The American Way of Poverty</i> is likely to cause fear--almost no one is exempt from unplanned disasters--but it is also likely to motivate: there are answers; this country can and should improve. Well researched and documented, Abramsky's eye-opening book should be required reading for all U.S. citizens."<br> <b>Shelf Awareness</b><br><br>"[A] searing expos�...

If one of my brothers needs me, I&#x2019;ll be there, day or night, drunk or sober. Even if I&#x2019;m drunk, and it&#x2019;s late at night, I&#x2019;m not going to complain.<br> <br>When I hear Talon&#x2019;s voice on the other end, however, my good mood and easy demeanor disappear. There&#x2019;s only one reason the president of the Wild Men MC would call me, and it&#x2019;s a moment I&#x2019;ve been dreading.<br> <br>&#x201c;We need to talk,&#x201d; he says. I stand up and move away from the others so I can have this conversation alone.<br> <br>I walk out front and stand by my bike, admiring her as I ask, &#x201c;What do you need?&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;s calling in the marker I owe him, I know it, and I just hope he doesn&#x2019;t want me to do something fucked-up. Recently, there was a little trouble involving another brother&#x2019;s old lady, Bailey. We had our hands full, and Talon stepped in to help by keeping the troublemaker involved, Amethyst, in his clubhouse while we did cleanup. Bailey&#x2019;s ex, Wade, who is her daughter Cara&#x2019;s biological father, tried to use them to get money from the Wind Dragons MC. Luckily Irish was there. He ended up stabbed, and Wade was killed. Just another day in the life.<br> <br>Of course, nothing is free, so I gave Talon my word that I&#x2019;d owe him a favor, one he could collect at a time of his choosing. My honor requires me to do whatever he needs, even though I can&#x2019;t stand the guy and I&#x2019;d rather be doing anything else right now.<br> <br>Like, fuckin&#x2019; anything.<br> <br>However, I hate owing anyone, so I&#x2019;m eager to get this over and done with.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pack a bag,&#x201d; Talon says on the other end. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be gone for a week.&#x201d; He doesn&#x2019;t sound smug, or even like he&#x2019;s enjoying calling in my debt. In fact, he sounds rather solemn. Why, I have no idea, but I guess I&#x2019;m going to find out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do I need to bring anything?&#x201d; I ask, wondering what weapons I might need. What the fuck did he want me to do for a week? Go with him on a run, maybe?<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope. I&#x2019;ll meet you at Rift tomorrow around lunchtime and explain everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I reply, curious now.<br> <br>We both hang up and my mind wanders with possibilities. I&#x2019;m glad he chose Rift because there&#x2019;s no way I&#x2019;m going to his clubhouse and he&#x2019;s not welcome here. We may both be bikers, but we&#x2019;re still from two different worlds, and those worlds don&#x2019;t mix. When I joined the WDMC, the Wild Men MC were our enemies, and even though it&#x2019;s not like that anymore, they aren&#x2019;t exactly our allies either. We own Rift, so he&#x2019;s actually giving me the power.<br> <br>Very interesting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everything all right?&#x201d; Sin, my president, asks as he walks outside and spots me staring down at the phone in my hand.<br> <br>I slide it in my pocket and say, &#x201c;Yeah. Talon&#x2019;s calling in his marker. I&#x2019;ll be gone for a week.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sin stills at that bit of information, then closes the space between us. &#x201c;What does he want?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find out tomorrow&#x2014;meeting him at Rift.&#x201d;<br> <br>He puts his hand on my shoulder. &#x201c;If you owe him a marker, we all do. Call me anytime&#x2014;you need anything, I&#x2019;m there. We&#x2019;re all there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I say, nodding.<br> <br>And I do&#x2014;the words don&#x2019;t even need to be spoken out loud. I&#x2019;ve been in this club for many years and seen lots of things along the way. I was just a prospect when Sin became president, and I earned my way to being a full-fledged member not shortly after. This club is my family, my backbone. Everything that I am. I don&#x2019;t intend on ever getting out, and I look forward to working my way up the ranks.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what the Wind Dragons are all about: a brotherhood based on loyalty and acceptance.<br> <br>We aren&#x2019;t saints, but the intention is there. We do what we have to to protect our own.<br> <br>And I wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go enjoy my last night of freedom for a week,&#x201d; I say, lightening the mood.<br> <br>Sin cracks a smile and says, &#x201c;The brunette?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shake my head. &#x201c;The blonde.&#x201d;<br> <br>He laughs and walks with me back inside the clubhouse, where I regain my seat and refill my glass. I call over the blonde I was eyeing and pull her onto my lap, wrapping one arm around her while the other hand nurses my drink. I see Arrow speaking to Sin before coming to sit next to me, not even glancing at the woman I&#x2019;m holding, or any other available woman in the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;When do you leave?&#x201d; he asks, looking me in the eye, tapping his hand on his knee. I fight the urge to smile. Sin sure passed that bit of info off quick.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tomorrow,&#x201d; I say as I squeeze the woman&#x2019;s ass. It&#x2019;s a nice one, round and firm.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want me to go with you?&#x201d; he asks, glancing away. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Talon won&#x2019;t give a fuck if there&#x2019;s an extra man there to help, and even if he did, fuck him. He wouldn&#x2019;t dare say shit to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I tell him quickly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be fine. I&#x2019;ll call you if I need you though, brother.&#x201d;<br> <br>The last thing Arrow needs is to get into shit with Talon, who has some weird friendship that no one really fuckin&#x2019; understands with his woman, Anna. Yeah, no more drama needed in that situation.<br> <br>He nods and stands.<br> <br>&#x201c;You going home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he replies, lifting his chin at me. &#x201c;You know where to find me if you need me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod, appreciating the fact that he and any of the men are just a phone call away, no matter what I need or what shit I need help getting out of. After Arrow leaves, the men start to clear out. I stand with the woman still in my arms, ignoring her girlish squeals, and carry her off to my room.<br> <br>Who knows what tomorrow will bring, but I&#x2019;m sure as hell gonna enjoy today.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding me,&#x201d; I say slowly as I stare at Talon in distaste. &#x201c;Why the fuck can&#x2019;t you or one of your men do this?&#x201d;<br> <br>Talon looks away, his white-blond hair covering his eyes as he looks down into his drink.<br> <br>&#x201c;No one wanted to. And instead of making one of my men do it, I thought, why the fuck not make it your problem?&#x201d; The bastard actually grins. &#x201c;Easy way out. And it&#x2019;s an easy enough task. You stay with her at the house, guard her for a week, keep her out of trouble until we put the fuckers that are after her in the ground, and then you go back home without owing me shit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So it could go for longer than a week?&#x201d; I ask, grinding my teeth.<br> <br>&#x201c;If it does,&#x201d; he says, taking a sip of his whiskey, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send one of the men to swap places with you. You owe me only a week. That&#x2019;s fair, yeah?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s after her?&#x201d; I ask him. &#x201c;And why?&#x201d;<br> <br>His lips press into a tight line before he replies. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s innocent, Vinnie, but her father isn&#x2019;t. Some people are trying to make her pay for the shit her old man&#x2019;s done, but I&#x2019;m not going to let that happen.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a vague answer, and I&#x2019;d have let him get away with it if it didn&#x2019;t affect me and how I handle the job at hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;The more I know, the better I can protect her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Her father is an accountant,&#x201d; he says, not looking happy about giving up added information. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in prison for fraud and embezzlement. Shayla worked for him, helping him with accounts or whatever he needed, except she didn&#x2019;t know and still doesn&#x2019;t really know just what kind of dodgy shit he was up to. She&#x2019;s not a certified accountant, she knows only what he taught her, which is fuckin&#x2019; convenient for him. That&#x2019;s all you need to know. Keep her safe. Easy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think I should know exactly who is after her?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not going to make a difference; the job remains the same,&#x201d; he replies, making me want to punch him in the face.<br> <br>Something&#x2019;s not sitting right with me. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s such an easy task,&#x201d; I ask, &#x201c;what the fuck is the catch? It&#x2019;s essentially a babysitting gig, easy enough. Hell, I&#x2019;ll crack a beer and watch some fuckin&#x2019; TV for a week&#x2014;sounds like a holiday.&#x201d;<br> <br>Talon throws his head back and laughs, his drink sloshing out of the glass. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a fuckin&#x2019; holiday. It&#x2019;s a test. A test of your fuckin&#x2019; patience.&#x201d; He studies me, searching my eyes. &#x201c;My cousin is a pain in the ass, Vinnie. None of the men want to watch her because she can be . . . a little difficult to manage.&#x201d; He cracks his neck from side to side while I process the fact that she is his cousin. I don&#x2019;t know how I feel about that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your cousin,&#x201d; I say slowly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he replies, eyes narrowing. &#x201c;My cousin, and I&#x2019;m fuckin&#x2019; trusting you with her, so don&#x2019;t treat her like the enemy because she&#x2019;s my family.&#x201d;<br> <br>Who the fuck does he think I am? I tighten my lips, not even justifying that comment with a response.<br> <br>&#x201c;I love her, don&#x2019;t get me wrong, but I know how stubborn and hardheaded she can be.&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s it? The girl was stubborn? That still doesn&#x2019;t add up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Big-ass bikers scared of a little girl?&#x201d; I joke, grinning.<br> <br>Talon pulls out his phone, presses a few buttons, and slides it over to me. I glance down at it and see a picture of a stunning Asian girl with long black hair, pale skin, and brown eyes. She is a petite little thing, with perfectly shaped lips that catch my attention.<br> <br>Fuck.<br> <br>&#x201c;This her?&#x201d;<br> <br>He nods and takes back his phone. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t want the job because yes, she&#x2019;s got an attitude problem at best, but also because she&#x2019;s fuckin&#x2019; gorgeous, and they know if they touch her in that way, or in any way, I will personally fuck them up.&#x201d; He pauses, studying me. &#x201c;I know how loyal you are, Vinnie&#x2014;to your club, to whoever you care about. And I know that you&#x2019;ll look after her better than any of my men could, and that&#x2019;s the damn truth.&#x201d;<br> <br>Better than his men?<br> <br>His words were true, of course, but I&#x2019;m still surprised at hearing them leave his lips. Perhaps he needed better men in his MC.<br> <br>His cousin was a beauty, sure, but I&#x2019;m not a man to be swayed by a pretty face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Message received,&#x201d; I reply, standing up from my stool. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m viewing this as a job, Talon. I protect your bratty cousin&#x2014;who, by the way, I have no idea how the fuck she&#x2019;s even your cousin, seeing as she doesn&#x2019;t look anything like you&#x2014;then I get my ass home and hopefully never see you again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shayla&#x2019;s adopted,&#x201d; Talon explains, also standing. &#x201c;Family isn&#x2019;t always about blood; you already know this.&#x201d; I nod. If I know anything in life to be true, it&#x2019;s that family is about loyalty, not blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll text you the address now; they&#x2019;re expecting you. It&#x2019;ll take you about four hours to get there, depending on the traffic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I say, just wanting it all over with. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about your cousin. I&#x2019;ll keep her safe.&#x201d;<br> <br>I can handle one girl. I don&#x2019;t give a fuck how much of an attitude she has.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Talon says, finishing the rest of his drink in one gulp. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t have asked you otherwise.&#x201d;<br> <br>He slams down his glass and leaves without another word.<br> <br>My phone beeps with a message from him, the address.<br> <br>Fuck.<br> <br>Well, no time like the present.<br> <br>I get on my bike and ride toward my new home for the next week.</p><h2>The Survival Retreat</h2><p>Win the battles of defending your retreat by avoiding them!

He made it possible for the Copper Scroll to be opened in Manchester and did much to focus worldwide attention on the Scrolls as a whole. But he made his name &#x2014; or gained his notoriety &#x2014; from questioning orthodox assumptions about how Christianity began. </p><p>Allegro's views soon set him apart from fellow Scrolls scholars and even from the church itself. He asked questions that many people found disturbing if not outrageous. He wondered, for example, about the interweaving of history, myth, faith, and tradition in the New Testament, and about the nature of the church's authority. Allegro went on challenging the establishment all his life, and he relished the arguments he provoked. For over thirty years he campaigned for open access to the Scrolls and for wider debate about their significance. To him it was a campaign for free speech and free opinion. </p><p>Judith Anne Brown's John Marco Allegro is a fascinating, probing, inside account of this man of ideas who was independent, irrepressible, and, above all, always original. Making extensive use of Allegro's letters, lecture notes, draft manuscripts, and other previously unpublished writings, Brown brings to life anew the extraordinary discoveries and debates that began in the caves by the Dead Sea over half a century ago.</p></p><p>Judith Anne Brown is the daughter of John Marco Allegro, a freelance writer and editor, and an associate of the Plain Language Commission. Her work on John Marco Allegro also appears in Manchester and the Dead Sea Scrolls (forthcoming), edited by George J. Brooke. She lives in Derbyshire, England, with her husband and two children.</p><h2>Maine&#39;s Golden Road: A Memoir</h2><p><p><strong><em>Maine's Golden Road</em> is a memoir of the annual vacation John Gould took for thirty-two consecutive summers with his daughter's father-in-law, Bill Dornbusch.</strong></p> Affectionately named "the Grandfathers' retreats," these sojourns into the depths of the Maine woods have inspired Gould's finest and most emotionally resonant writing to date.<br><br> With a naturalist's sensitivity to his environment, and his great good humor, Gould writes of hiking through dense forests, of fly fishing for salmon and trout in deserted creeks, of campside culinary triumphs, and of friendship and shared reflections on careers, family, and the modern world. The resulting book is a wonderful, memorable meditation on the beauty of the Maine woods and on John Gould's ever-interesting life.<br></p><p>John Gould lives in Friendship, Maine.For three decades, Gould (Dispatches from Maine, LJ 4/15/94) and his son's father-in-law took annual summer retreats to camp and fish in Thoreau's Maine woods. This uneven collection of essays relates some of their humorous experiences, discusses the positive aspects of the logging industry, ponders the absurdities of Maine's moose-hunting laws, and examines the local lore and customs. Gould enjoys comparing his misadventures with Thoreau's more serious observations. Whether writing about a patient moose being photographed by a camera that fails to cooperate or about a brood of 13 ducklings that passes between his friend's legs when he's trying to pull in his first salmon, Gould shows a keen affection for the woods and its inhabitants. His mildly entertaining memoir is appropriate mainly for regional collections.<br><i>Ilse Heidmann Ali, Kyle Community Lib., Tex.</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: France</h2><p><p><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: France</i> will lead you straight to the best attractions the country has to offer.

It&#x2019;s not the size that counts. It&#x2019;s the sharpness. And the angle. The blade must sing. Not scratch.</p><p>I hold the piece of blue glass up to the window light. It&#x2019;s the same color as the type you occasionally see in bottles lining the shelves of old-fashioned pharmacies. A nice clean cut. No sharp bits that need trimming, which is always tricky. So easy to get splinters of glass in your skin or on your clothes.</p><p>Or in your mind.</p><p>Now for the acid test. Does the glass fit the lead outline? My heart always starts to beat wildly at this stage, as though it&#x2019;s a matter of life or death. Silly, really, but that&#x2019;s how it feels. After getting this far, you don&#x2019;t want to get it wrong.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you mind helping me with this, Mrs. Baker?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, it&#x2019;s miss,&#x201d; I say, looking up from my demo piece. &#x201c;And please, call me Alison.&#x201d;</p><p>A new student stands in front of me. He&#x2019;s substantial without being&nbsp; chunky&#x2014;six foot one and a half, at a guess, and three inches or so taller than me.</p><p>As a child, I was teased mercilessly for being the tallest in the class. I did my best to shrink, but it didn&#x2019;t work. &#x201c;Stand up straight,&#x201d; my mother would plead. She meant well, but all I wanted to do was blend in; not to be&nbsp; noticed&#x2014;to hide my slightly overlarge nose, my thick-framed mud brown glasses and my braces. My perfectly put-together sister, on the other hand, had that gift of innate confidence that made her naturally poised.</p><p>Nowadays, I&#x2019;ve learned there are some advantages to my height. You can carry off clothes that others can&#x2019;t, or put on a pound or two without it showing. Yet, every time I pass my reflection in a mirror or shop window, I am reminded to push back those offending shoulders.</p><p>&#x201c;Alison?&#x201d; I am jolted back to the present.</p><p>The man asking the question is&#x2014;at a guess&#x2014;in his mid- to-late thirties like me. The more the years go by, the less I want to give out an exact figure. It makes me panic about the things I thought I&#x2019;d have done by now and that somehow haven&#x2019;t happened.</p><p>In fact, this is the one place where maturity doesn&#x2019;t matter. It&#x2019;s the steadiness of the hand that counts. Making stained glass windows might seem like an innocuous craft, but accidents happen.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t quite remember, Alison, what you said about stretching the lead.&#x201d;</p><p>The man&#x2019;s voice is deep as it slices through my thoughts. Not many men sign up for these weekly courses I run at the local college. When this particular student arrived at the first session last week, I felt an instant fluttering of unease.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not just the way he keeps staring. Or his intelligent questions. Or the confident manner in which he scores his glass, even though it&#x2019;s a beginners&#x2019; class. Or his&nbsp; name&#x2014;Clive Black, which has an authoritative abruptness. Nor is it even the way he said &#x201c;Alison&#x201d; just now, as though he found it intriguing rather than everyday.</p><p>It&#x2019;s all of these things. And something else, too, that I can&#x2019;t put a finger on. Over the years, I&#x2019;ve learned to trust my instinct. And it&#x2019;s telling me, right now, to watch out.</p><p>Wearing my protective gloves, I pick up a thin, slightly twisted piece of lead, about a foot long. It always reminds me of a strand of silver licorice, the type my sister and I used to buy from the corner shop on the way back from school.</p><p>Swiftly, I hand Clive a pair of pliers. &#x201c;Take one piece&#x2014;the flat edge of the pliers needs to be on&nbsp; top&#x2014;and pull. I&#x2019;ll do the same at the other end. Lean forward. That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Amazing how it doubles in length!&#x201d; he says in awe.</p><p>&#x201c;Incredible, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; breathes someone else as the class gathers round. I love this bit. Excitement is catching.</p><p>I pick up a different trimming knife. The funny thing is that I&#x2019;ve been clumsy ever since childhood, yet this is the one area where I never falter.</p><p>&#x201c;Next, we&#x2019;ll wiggle the blade from side to side and then push down,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Anyone want to try?&#x201d;</p><p>I address my question deliberately to a horsey-faced woman who has been in several of my courses. Once, she even offered to leave a positive review on my Facebook page and was distinctly disappointed when I confessed to not having one. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you need it to publicize your work?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d asked incredulously.</p><p>I&#x2019;d shrugged casually in an attempt to hide the real reason. &#x201c;I manage without it.&#x201d;</p><p>Class is ending now, but the man with the deep voice&#x2014; Clive&#x2014;is still lurking.</p><p>In my experience, there&#x2019;s always a <i>May I ask a final question?</i> student who doesn&#x2019;t want to go. But this one is unnerving me.</p><p>&#x201c;I was just wondering,&#x201d; he says. Then he stops for a minute, his eyes darting to the blank space on my wedding ring finger. &#x201c;Are you hungry, by any chance?&#x201d;</p><p>He laughs casually, as if aware he is being slightly too forward on the strength of a short acquaintance in which I am the teacher and he is the pupil. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about you,&#x201d; he adds, &#x201c;but I didn&#x2019;t have time to eat anything after work before coming here.&#x201d;</p><p>His hand reaches into his pocket as he talks. Sweat breaks out round my neck. Then he brings out a watch and glances at it. The face appears to have a Disney cartoon on it. I&#x2019;m both relieved and intrigued.</p><p>But not enough to accept his invitation.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I say lightly, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m expected back at home.&#x201d;</p><p>He looks disappointed. &#x201c;OK. I understand.&#x201d;</p><p>Turning round, I tidy up the spare glass offcuts, putting one of them away for later.</p><p>On paper, Clive seems like someone my mother would approve of. Nice manners. Seemingly educated. A man of means, judging from his well-cut jacket. A good head of light brown hair, flicked back off a wide forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re being too choosy,&#x201d; my mother is always saying, albeit kindly. &#x201c;Sometimes, you have to take a risk in life, darling. Mister Right can come in all shapes and forms.&#x201d;</p><p>Was this how she&#x2019;d felt about marrying my father? I&#x2019;m stung by that familiar pang of loss. If only he was still here.</p><p>Clive has gone now. All I want to do is go back to my flat in Elephant and Castle, put on some Ella Fitzgerald, knock up a tinned tuna salad, take a hot shower to wash out the day, then curl up on the sofa with a good book and try to forget that the rent is due next week.</p><p>Peeling off my rubber gloves, I wash my hands carefully in the corner sink. Then, slipping on my fluffy blue mohair thrift store cardigan, I make my way downstairs, pausing at reception to hand in the classroom key. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d; asks the woman at the desk.</p><p>I put on my cheerful face. &#x201c;Great, thanks. You?&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugs. &#x201c;Fine. I&#x2019;ve got to rearrange the noticeboard. Someone&#x2019;s just dropped this off. Not sure that anyone will be interested. What do you think?&#x201d;</p><p>I read the poster.</p><p>WANTED: ARTIST IN RESIDENCE FOR HMP ARCHVILLE (A MEN&#x2019;S OPEN PRISON). ONE HOUR FROM CENTRAL LONDON. THREE DAYS A WEEK.

Her words bring me back to myself, and I fumble for a pen.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not really interested, are you, Alison?&#x201d;</p><p>I continue writing down the e-mail address. &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rather you than me.&#x201d;</p><p>The pros and cons whirl round in my head as I make my way out into the street. Steady income. Travel costs. Enough to stop me worrying over my bank balance every month. But I&#x2019;ve never been inside a prison before, and the thought terrifies me. My mouth is dry. My heart is thumping. I wish I&#x2019;d never seen the ad.</p><p>I pass a park with teenagers smoking on the swings. One is laughing, head tossed back in a happy, carefree laugh. Just like my sister&#x2019;s. For her, life was a ball. Me? I was the serious one. Earnest. Even before the accident, I remember a certain mysterious heaviness in my chest. I always wanted to make things right. To do the best I could in life. The word &#x201c;conscientious&#x201d; featured on every one of my school reports.</p><p>But there are some things you can&#x2019;t make right.</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t your fault,&#x201d; my mother had said, time and time again. Yet, when I replay it in my mind, I keep thinking of things I could have done. And now it&#x2019;s too late.</p><p>I&#x2019;m walking briskly through an evening market. Silk scarves flutter in the breeze. Turquoise. Pink. Primrose yellow. On the next stall, overripe tomatoes are going for 50p a bag. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t get cheaper, love,&#x201d; says the stallholder, who is wearing black fingerless gloves. I ignore him and take a left then a right. I go down a road of identical Victorian terraces with overflowing wheelie bins and beer bottles in the streets. Some homes here have curtains, while others have boarded-up windows. Mine has shutters.</p><p>There are three name stickers by three bells: my landlord&#x2019;s, the other tenant&#x2019;s, and a blank&#x2014;mine. I reach for my key and move into the main hall where the post is left. Nothing for me. The second key lets me into my ground-floor one-bedroom apartment. I&#x2019;d have liked a room on the second floor, as it would have felt safer, but I couldn&#x2019;t find one at the time, and I was desperate. Now I am used to it, although I always make sure the windows are locked before I leave the house.</p><p>Shutting the door, I kick off my shoes and chuck my bag on to the secondhand beige Ikea sofa.</p><p>The yearning starts inside me. Hurry. Fast. My hands dive down for the sliver of blue in my jacket pocket like an alcoholic might reach for the bottle. To think that something so small can do such damage!</p><p>Today it&#x2019;s the turn of my right wrist. Far enough from the artery, but deeper than yesterday&#x2019;s. I gasp as the jagged edge scores my skin, and a dark thrill flashes through me followed by the pain. I need both.</p><p>But it&#x2019;s no good. It doesn&#x2019;t hurt enough. Never does.</p><p>For it&#x2019;s the cuts we hide inside that really do the damage. They rub and they niggle and they bruise and they bleed. And as the pain and anxiety grow in your head, they become far more dangerous than a visible open wound. Until eventually, you have to do something.</p><p>And now that time has come.</p></p><h2>Start-A-Craft Basket Making</h2><p>A guide to making a wide variety of baskets with simple, easy-to-follow instructions uses traditional basket-making techniques to make practical, useful baskets out of cane, cardboard, and raffia that require no special equipment or expertise.</p><p></p><h2>Waiting for Godot: A Tragicomedy in Two Acts</h2><p>&#34;Waiting for Godot,&#34; a tragicomedy in two acts, brought overnight fame to its 51-year-old Irish author.

Though Milly loves her mother, the only way to make her stop is to turn her in to the police. Milly is given a fresh start: a new identity, a home with an affluent foster family, and a spot at an exclusive private school. </p><p>But Milly has secrets, and life at her new home becomes complicated. As her mother&#x2019;s trial looms, with Milly as the star witness, Milly starts to wonder how much of her is nature, how much of her is nurture, and whether she is doomed to turn out like her mother after all. </p><p>When tensions rise and Milly feels trapped by her shiny new life, she has to decide: Will she be good? Or is she bad? She is, after all, her mother's daughter.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of September 2017:</strong> Who hasn&#x2019;t wanted to do a very bad thing? Fifteen-year-old Milly battles these urges daily, but she not only has the desire to be wicked; she&#x2019;s had the training to make her impulses reality. The daughter of a female serial killer who preyed on young children, Milly was raised in a nightmare of abuse and butchery. By turning in her mother to the police, Milly has escaped. But has she really? <p>Debut author Ali Land is devious: She only hints at the horrors Milly experienced, forcing the reader to fill in the gaps. A brief scene in which Milly dissects a pig heart in biology class includes the chilling, almost throwaway line, &#x201c;I know a lot about a person&#x2019;s insides.&#x201d; Milly wants her &#x201c;good me&#x201d; aspect to win, but relentless bullying at school, her unhealthy friendship with another lost teen, and the pressure of testifying against her mother gnaw at Milly, allowing her darker instincts to ooze through her defenses. Your own impulses will veer between wanting to protect Milly and dreading what she&#x2019;s capable of. Readers will have differing reactions to the ending, so when you&#x2019;ve finished <em>Good Me Bad Me</em>, swiftly hand it over to a friend so you can unravel the conclusion together. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, Amazon Book Review </em></p>Ali Land graduated from university with a degree in Mental Health and spent a decade working as a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Nurse.
